This bookdown document is intended to be used for incoming, current, and outgoing members of the Gaynor Lab group. See published version [here](https://gaynor-lab.github.io/lab-manual/). If we missed anything, please let Kaitlyn Gaynor (gaynor@zoology.ubc.ca) know. You can also do a pull request and I will review the changesâ€”this is meant to be a living document and will evolve with the group!
