# Lab member expectations {#expectations}

All lab members are expected to adhere to our lab philosophy (Chapter \@ref(philosophy)), communication practices (Chapter \@ref(communication)), research practices (Chapter \@ref(research)), and fieldwork policies (Chapter \@ref(fieldwork)), as outlined elsewhere in this manual.


## UBC requirements

All lab members are responsible for keeping on top of paperwork related to their own payroll, HR, travel, reimbursements, etc. We can use this lab manual and lab Slack to share information and resources with one another.

Graduate students are responsible for degree progress. This means you need to stay on top of program and university deadlines, requirements, etc. Before registering for courses each term, meet with Kaitlyn to discuss your plans.

## Research output

level of research independence vary by level - increasingly independent from undergraduate to MSc to PhD to postdoctoral researchers

### Publication

Publication in peer-reviewed journals is an important part of the scientific research process. 

Graduate students are expected to submit half of their chapters to peer-reviewed journals prior to sign-off on their thesis. For PhD students, the expectation is that you submit one chapter to both your committee and a peer-reviewed publication within the first 3.5 years in the program, and a second within the first 5.

Kaitlyn and other lab members will support you in navigating the peer-review process, including journal selection, responses to reviewers, and payment of publication costs.

When you leave the lab, make a plan with Kaitlyn for the timeline and process of submission of any additional first-authored papers from your time in the lab. If your plans change and you can no longer commit to the publication process on the timeline that we discussed, other members of the Gaynor Lab will be given the opportunity to follow through on the work (with credit given to your contributions, of course). Kaitlyn will talk to you to make a plan well before we reach this point.


### Conferences

Members of the Gaynor Lab are expected to share our research at local, national, and international meetings. We will share information with each other on upcoming conferences, and provide feedback on drafts of posters and presentations in lab meeting.

Kaitlyn aims to provide financial support for lab members to attend conferences annually, dependent on the availability of funding, and all lab members should seek external funding as well.

## Funding

All lab members are encouraged to seek and apply for extramural funding to support their work. This includes scholarships and fellowships to pay for salary, but also smaller grants for travel, workshop attendance, or research costs.

As a general rule, all graduate students should apply for at least one grant or fellowship every year. 

Graduating students and postdoctoral researchers are encouraged to apply for funding to support their next steps.

Collaboration and independence

### Peer support

Everybody in the Gaynor Lab should seek to provide mentorship, technical support, and assistance to other lab members, especially more senior members of the group.

### Attendance and participation

All lab members are expected to attend lab meetings, BRC and departmental seminars, and lab member defenses. We should all make an effort to attend social events put on by the lab, BRC, and departments, especially those within normal work hours. 

We are all busy, and there will always be something to do that feels more "productive" or urgent than attending a seminar or social event, but we should all recognize that these events are critical for building community. Ultimately, investment in relationships in our professional community will build a network to uplift and support our research, set the groundwork for new collaborations, and lead to new professional opportunities.

Even if a talk is outside of your area of interest, use it as an opportunity to reflect on effective (and ineffective) presentation approaches.

## Work schedule

### Work hours

We should all set the working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this 'fit' is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with your main collaborator to outline these. 

There is value to interacting with others as part of your work, and we do expect you will be available during normal working hours for at least some of the time during the week. Lab members should not expect others to be available during evenings and weekends. We also recognize that there will occasionally be times where there is a need to work more to meet a deadline, but this should be the exception - an expectation of overwork is not to be normalized.

### Time budgeting

For graduate students and postdocs, plan to spend 40 hours/week on research, teaching, and professional development activities. The exact breakdown of this time will depend on the nature of your appointment (e.g., TA and RA positions). Some people find that counting all 'billable hours' is productive for them as it helps them keep accountable to themselves (Kaitlyn uses [Toggl](https://toggl.com) for this purpose). Others do not find this method useful. Regularly assess what works best for you.
