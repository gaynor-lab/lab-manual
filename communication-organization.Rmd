## Meetings

### Lab meetings

Beginning in Fall 2023, our lab will hold weekly 90-minute lab meetings in person on campus. 

All lab members will sign up to lead meetings on a rotating basis, and will be responsible for setting the agenda for their weeks. The purpose of these lab meetings is to solicit group feedback on research ideas and progress (and, occasionally, professional development). You might use this time to share a draft of a grant proposal, thesis proposal, or manuscript, discuss a paper relevant to your interests, or give a practice talk. All written materials should be shared with the group at least one week before lab meeting. 

All lab members are expected to attend weekly, unless in the field, and to provide written comments on materials in advance of the meeting. 

We will rotate note-taking responsibilities and maintain notes in the lab Google Drive folder.

#### Giving feedback to your labmates {-}

We will share feedback respectfully and constructively. This [resource from the University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/assessing-student-work/grading-and-feedback/receiving-and-giving-effective-feedback) outlines the main points of how to give and receive feedback. 

When sending material, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for the lab to help you.

Feedback shared in the context of lab meeting does not merit coauthorship on manuscripts, although collaborations are encouraged outside of them, and it is good practice to recognize those who gave feedback in Acknowledgement sections as relevant. 

### Individual meetings with Kaitlyn

We schedule regular 30-minute weekly individual meetings with Kaitlyn throughout the year. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with Kaitlyn to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, not Kaitlyn’s. Even if you don't have anything urgent to discuss, this regularity is important for maintaining open communication, and we'll fill the time each week!

Each lab member will have a designated Google Doc (visible only to you and Kaitlyn) for agendas and notes for our weekly meetings. (Following templates posted on Twitter by Susana Wadgymar and Michael Hoffman.) By 11am on the day of our weekly meeting, update this file with the following information (don’t spend any more than 15 minutes on this, and don’t feel the need to use complete sentences):

+ Make a short agenda of any things you’d like to discuss in our meeting, in addition to your research plans and progress (if you have anything else to discuss, which may not be the case). I may add to these as well.
+ Annotate the plans from the previous week using the ‘Comment’ feature or by adding text in a different color. We’ll use these notes as a tool for assessing whether we are developing SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-Bound) plans
+ Write a brief self-reflection on the previous week. This reflection is open-ended, but I suggest discussing what went well, what you found to be the most challenging, what you did to try to overcome those challenges, lessons learned, things that I/others can help with, and notes to yourself on what you would do differently in the upcoming weeks.
+ Draft a list of plans and priorities for the upcoming week.



## Communication channels

### E-mail

Use UBC e-mail for sharing written (non-code) materials or for other communication that would benefit from a searchable record or longer form. 

You should check your e-mail daily during the work week (M-F). If you do not expect to be able to respond to your e-mails within a day or two, set up an out-of-office reply. 

Do not expect responses to emails after regular business hours on weekdays, or on weekends. However, because we recognize that lab members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, lab members should not be penalized for sending communication during these times.   

### GitHub

Use GitHub issues within the appropriate project repository for discussion of data management and analysis. This allows for an easily-searchable record of notes, decisions, and discussions that can be easily linked to specific code.

You should set up your GitHub notifications so that you receive an email whenever there is action on a GitHub issue in a repository to which you contribute. You will then be able to stay on top of conversations and respond directly to issues via e-mail.

For specific questions on coding problems, please try to create a minimal reproducible example. Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared.  

See more on the use of GitHub below.

### Slack

We have a Gaynor Lab Slack organization, to be used for quick questions or topics for group discussion. Keep in mind that Slack does not have a permanent archive, and that GitHub is better for any project-related conversations for which an easily-searchable archive is preferable.

For non-time-sensitive questions for Kaitlyn, add them to your agenda for your weekly meeting and plan to discuss them in person, rather than using Slack. 

### Phone

Maybe we could set up a lab phone line, but who uses land lines anymore? For urgent situations or emergencies, you may call or text group members’ cell phones. Please reserve this channel of communication for rare cases so that we can all maintain our work-life balance and boundaries. 

### Google Drive

We have a Gaynor Lab Google Drive folder, which contains meeting notes and relevant shared documents.

We will also use this folder to store lab publications, presentations, photos, and data.

Everything in this folder should remain internal to the Gaynor Lab unless permission is given to share it more widely.

### Lab manual

Any information that comes up on Slack or email that is valuable for lab institutional knowledge should be added this lab manual via a pull request. 



## Online presence

### Google Scholar profiles

Having a Google Scholar profile is a very easy way to curate your web presence and have a place where people can find you and your published papers and reports.  

We recommend everyone sets up a Google Scholar profile as soon as they have a paper or technical report. It takes about 5-10 minutes to set up, and one advantage is that Google Scholar self-updates and will add your papers and citations as you publish and people use your work. This is a really easy step to creating a web presence without having to set up a website.


### Personal websites

**Why have your own website?**

1. People will Google you. They might as well see what you want them to.
2. Give people an easy way to find you and your work.

One way to do this is a personal website. This doesn't have to be extensive, but can be a good way to curate your web presence.  

There are heaps of tools out there to create and publish websites. Our recommendation is to choose something that it is easy to update, and fun / interesting for you to use. Many options are free.  

Some options for creating sites include: GoogleSites, Weebly, Squarespace, WordPress, R Markdown, GitHub.
