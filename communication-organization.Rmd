## Onboarding

Welcome to the Gaynor Lab! In addition to the official UBC onboarding process (obtaining study/work permits, getting set up with payroll), which you should coordinate with the appropriate departmental staff members, here are some things that you should talk about Kaitlyn about doing when you arrive:

+ Read through this lab manual!
+ Join the Gaynor Lab and Biodiversity Research Centre Slack organizations (ask Kaitlyn for an invite if needed)
+ Join the lab Google Drive
+ Join a shared Google Drive folder with Kaitlyn
+ Join the lab [GitHub organization](https://github.com/gaynor-lab)
+ Write your Individual Development Plan (Kaitlyn will share template and guidance)
+ Set up a regular meeting time with Kaitlyn
+ Get your [UBC card](https://ubccard.ubc.ca/)
+ Get your keys; if you are in the BRC or Ponderosa E, Katie Beall will order them for you, and you'll pick the up at the UBC bookstore
+ UBC offers access to software for students and staff. If you need MS Office, GIS, etc. you can download them [here](https://it.ubc.ca/services/desktop-print-services/software-licensing/list-software-available)
+ Set up a UBC Zoom account (will allow Zoom calls of unlimited duration... though one could argue about whether this is a "perk")
+ Complete any mandatory on-boarding courses on Workday

## Meetings

### Lab meetings

Our lab holds weekly 90-minute lab meetings, in person on campus. The first ~30 minutes will be dedicated to individual updates and lab business/announcements. The remaining 60 minutes will be dedicated to the primary topic of the lab meeting.

All lab members will sign up to lead meetings on a rotating basis, and will be responsible for setting the agenda for their weeks. The purpose of these lab meetings is to solicit group feedback on research ideas and progress (and, occasionally, professional development). You might use this time to share a draft of a grant proposal, thesis proposal, or manuscript, discuss a paper relevant to your interests, or give a practice talk. 

All lab members are expected to attend weekly, unless in the field, and to provide written comments on materials in advance of the meeting. In-person attendance is expected for those in Vancouver, but joining remotely is an option when traveling. Please note any virtual attendance or absences on the lab meeting spreadsheet.

We will rotate note-taking responsibilities and maintain notes in the lab Google Drive folder.

#### Prep work for lab meeting {-}

The goal of lab meeting is not simply to provide updates on our research projects with one another, but rather to spend dedicated time thinking deeply about ideas as a collective. This is one of the few spaces on campus where we can meaningfully workshop our research with others, so make the most of it! Ideally, we can use the hour to discuss, rather than get up to speed. 

Given this goal, we should all expect to complete some prep work prior to lab meeting in most cases (and plan to assign it when we are leading). Prep work is also valuable because many people (myself included) come up with better ideas when there is some time to let them marinate, and individual reflection prevents groupthink (a lack of creativity when a group coalesces on the same ideas together). This prep work may involve looking through a draft of a manuscript, proposal, grant application, poster, figure, or published paper that is inspiring your thinking. If you aren't sure what to assign, ask yourself: what background information do I need to share in order for everybody to get up to speed before we discuss? How can I share this information ahead of time, rather than spending half of lab meeting presenting it?

All written materials should be shared with the group via e-mail at least five days before lab meeting (by the Thursday before). We should avoid working on collaborative Google Docs at this stage, again to avoid groupthink, and instead develop our independent ideas. 

When sending material, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for the lab to help you. If you are asking for feedback, clarify what kind of feedback (big picture ideas vs. line edits on grammar). If there are particular things you are stuck on, or want to discuss, flag these in advance. If you would like to discuss research ideas, provide some questions that will seed the discussion.

All lab members should come to lab meeting ready to dive in. Ideally, if you are providing written comments, you should send them to the lab meeting leader in advance of lab meeting so they can review them and integrate them into their agenda.

#### Giving feedback to your labmates {-}

We will share feedback respectfully and constructively. This [resource from the University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/assessing-student-work/grading-and-feedback/receiving-and-giving-effective-feedback) outlines the main points of how to give and receive feedback. 

Feedback shared in the context of lab meeting does not merit coauthorship on manuscripts, although collaborations are encouraged outside of them, and it is good practice to recognize those who gave feedback in Acknowledgement sections as relevant. 

### Individual meetings with Kaitlyn

We schedule regular 30-minute weekly individual meetings with Kaitlyn throughout the year. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with Kaitlyn to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, not Kaitlyn’s. Even if you don't have anything urgent to discuss, this regularity is important for maintaining open communication, and we'll fill the time each week!

Please see these guidelines for [“What to bring to a meeting with your advisor”](http://www.avasthilab.org/2017/03/14/what-to-bring-to-a-meeting-with-your-advisor/) - I think they do a great job of emphasizing what these meetings are for, and how to get the most from them!

Each lab member will have a designated Google Doc (visible only to you and Kaitlyn) for agendas and notes for our weekly meetings. (Following templates posted on Twitter by Susana Wadgymar and Michael Hoffman.) By 11am on the day of our weekly meeting, update this file with the following information (don’t spend any more than 15 minutes on this, and don’t feel the need to use complete sentences):

+ Make a short agenda of any things you’d like to discuss in our meeting, in addition to your research plans and progress (if you have anything else to discuss, which may not be the case). I may add to these as well.
+ Annotate the plans from the previous week using the ‘Comment’ feature or by adding text in a different color. We’ll use these notes as a tool for assessing whether we are developing SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-Bound) plans
+ Write a brief self-reflection on the previous week. This reflection is open-ended, but I suggest discussing what went well, what you found to be the most challenging, what you did to try to overcome those challenges, lessons learned, things that I/others can help with, and notes to yourself on what you would do differently in the upcoming weeks.
+ Draft a list of plans and priorities for the upcoming week.



## Communication channels

### E-mail

Use UBC e-mail for sharing written (non-code) materials or for other communication that would benefit from a searchable record or longer form. 

You should check your e-mail daily during the work week (M-F). If you do not expect to be able to respond to your e-mails within a day or two, set up an out-of-office reply. 

Do not expect responses to emails after regular business hours on weekdays, or on weekends. However, because we recognize that lab members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, lab members should not be penalized for sending communication during these times.   

#### E-mail etiquette

Borrowed from WildCo:

Always remember to use a respectful tone and pay attention to proper spelling and grammar when communicating with others about your research. Start emails with a greeting (Dear Dr. So-and-So ...). There is a tendency to be informal in communications, but many of your mentors or senior colleagues may prefer somewhat more traditional communications -- why start off on the wrong foot? You can adapt to their style (and yours) as the conversation continues.

Try to keep emails brief and to the point. What response do you need and by when?

Be prepared to follow up on an email if you haven’t had a response in 1-2 weeks. Many people are overwhelmed with emails and simply can’t keep up, so a non-response likely reflects an oversight and people will be happy for a reminder. (Continued non-response after ~3 emails likely means the person is too busy to engage at this time. Try knocking on their door or calling their office if it is important.)

If there is an action item or deadline associated with your email, make it very clear (e.g. bold, included in the first line or few).


### GitHub

Use GitHub issues within the appropriate project repository for discussion of data management and analysis. This allows for an easily-searchable record of notes, decisions, and discussions that can be easily linked to specific code.

You should set up your GitHub notifications so that you receive an email whenever there is action on a GitHub issue in a repository to which you contribute. You will then be able to stay on top of conversations and respond directly to issues via e-mail.

For specific questions on coding problems, please try to create a minimal reproducible example. Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared.  

See more on the use of GitHub below.

### Slack

We have a Gaynor Lab Slack organization, to be used for quick questions or topics for group discussion. Keep in mind that Slack does not have a permanent archive, and that GitHub is better for any project-related conversations for which an easily-searchable archive is preferable.

New channels can be suggested/added as needed (but do not overload with public channels, new channels should be suggested to the lab and agreed upon by everyone).

For non-time-sensitive questions for Kaitlyn, add them to your agenda for your weekly meeting and plan to discuss them in person, rather than using Slack. As a rule of thumb, if you have a quick question for Kaitlyn that she can answer from her phone on the bus, send it via Slack; if it will require more time, action, or thought, send it via e-mail.

### Phone

Maybe we could set up a lab phone line, but who uses land lines anymore? For urgent situations or emergencies, you may call or text group members’ cell phones. Please reserve this channel of communication for rare cases so that we can all maintain our work-life balance and boundaries. 

### Google Drive

We have a Gaynor Lab Google Drive folder, which contains meeting notes and relevant shared documents. We will also use this folder to store lab publications, presentations, photos, and data. Everything in this folder should remain internal to the Gaynor Lab unless permission is given to share it more widely.

In addition, each lab member will have a designated Google Drive folder shared only with Kaitlyn. This folder will house the Individual Development Plan and weekly meeting notes. Beyond that, you can organize it however you prefer. However, any Google documents that you wish to share with Kaitlyn should be placed somewhere in this folder so that they can be easily tracked down later and not get lost in the vast universe of shared Google Docs.

### Lab manual

Any information that comes up on Slack or email that is valuable for lab institutional knowledge should be added this lab manual via a pull request. 

## Online presence

### Google Scholar profiles

Having a Google Scholar profile is a very easy way to curate your web presence and have a place where people can find you and your published papers and reports.  

We recommend everyone sets up a Google Scholar profile as soon as they have a paper or technical report. It takes about 5-10 minutes to set up, and one advantage is that Google Scholar self-updates and will add your papers and citations as you publish and people use your work. This is a really easy step to creating a web presence without having to set up a website.


### Personal websites

**Why have your own website?**

1. People will Google you. They might as well see what you want them to.
2. Give people an easy way to find you and your work.

One way to do this is a personal website. This doesn't have to be extensive, but can be a good way to curate your web presence.  

There are heaps of tools out there to create and publish websites. Our recommendation is to choose something that it is easy to update, and fun / interesting for you to use. Many options are free.  

Some options for creating sites include: GoogleSites, Weebly, Squarespace, WordPress, R Markdown, GitHub.
