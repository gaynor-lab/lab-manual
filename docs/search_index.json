[["index.html", "Gaynor Lab Manual Policies, expectations, and guidance for members of our research group at UBC Welcome!", " Gaynor Lab Manual Policies, expectations, and guidance for members of our research group at UBC Authored by Kaitlyn Gaynor Updated 2024-08-19 Welcome! The Gaynor Lab at the University of British Columbia is based in the Departments of Zoology and Botany, and affiliated with the Biodiversity Research Centre (BRC) and the Interdisciplinary Biodiversity Solutions (IBioS) Collaboratory. Our research examines the effects of human activity on global biodiversity, with emphases on (1) the behavioral responses of animals to human presence, (2) the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on predator-prey and other species interactions, and (3) the socio-ecological dynamics of conservation and coexistence. You can read more about our research group on the Gaynor Lab website. This lab manual is a living document, and is meant to provide a central place for current and future members of the Gaynor Lab to access information about our policies, expectations, and collaboration and research practices. &lt;- link to this book’s GitHub repository Acknowledgements The University of British Columbia Vancouver campus is situated on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam). Much of the content in this lab manual came from other public manuals, including the Faylab Lab Manual, Pinsky Lab, and Bahlai Lab, the UBC WildCo Lab Handbook, and expectation documents from Somayeh Dodge (University of California Santa Barbara), Briana Abrahms (University of Washington), and Jerod Merkle (University of Wyoming). "],["philosophy.html", "Chapter 1 Lab philosophy and code of conduct 1.1 Lab philosophy 1.2 Code of conduct", " Chapter 1 Lab philosophy and code of conduct This section on lab philosophy and code of conduct is taken almost entirely verbatim from The Faylab Lab Manual, because it resonated so fully with me. It is to be revisited with Gaynor Lab as it grows, so that we can collectively define our own philosophy and culture. 1.1 Lab philosophy As part of our core lab culture, we: Ask for help, and share our learning Make ourselves available Come prepared and engage Celebrate accomplishments (ours &amp; those of others) Sustain a positive, safe learning environment Have an interdisciplinary (open) mindset Are mindful of our own biases Plan with intention, and follow through Foster inclusivity within our group and greater community Promote and sustain healthy work-life integration Practice radical candor Acknowledge and give credit to other lab member’s work Ask for help, and share your learning We are all learners, and most of our learning is done from each other. It is inefficient to struggle through problems alone. Ask for and give assistance with appropriate cognizance of the value of your time and the time of the person you are asking. You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem, add an issue to the appropriate GitHub repository, and update it with solutions when it is resolved. Also consider sharing it with the larger community by tweeting, leading and sharing at a lab meeting, or running a workshop. Make yourself available Be responsive to communication, and make time for things that address longer term goals, even when busy. For example, do not skip on things like attending seminars just because you have a big deadline looming. Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Because as a group we value the role of collaboration and interaction in improving our work, it is typically expected that you be available in the lab/office during normal business hours for some time during the week. Come prepared and be engaged Value your time. Be present during lab and individual meetings, and come to your work ready to do your work. Contribute and participate in planning and lab discussions. When it is your turn to run a meeting, come with an agenda and be prepared with questions. Aim to view meetings as events that contribute to your work and productivity, rather than taking away from them. Celebrate accomplishments (yours &amp; others) You and your colleagues work hard. Things don’t always go exactly as you plan. Be supportive and proud of yourself and your peers when you accomplish things. We are not competing with each other - someone else’s success does not mean your failure. Share your accomplishments with others! Sustain a positive, safe learning environment Everyone learns something for the first time at some time, and people learn in different ways. Expressing that you don’t know something is OK, and we understand that this can make someone feel vulnerable. We strive to maintain a culture that allows for and encourages this vulnerability. Community members should not be disparaged for not knowing things, and in addition, should not be disparaged for knowing things or wanting to learn. Have an interdisciplinary (open) mindset We work on problems that span multiple disciplines. Co-creation of knowledge requires transdisciplinary approaches that can result in solutions that would not be possible with siloing. You will be collaborating with others who have different types of expertise, values, and terminology. Trust the expertise of others and actively seek feedback recognizing the importance of specialization. Be mindful and aware of your own biases We all have biases that are inherent and can not be removed, but we can still work on both being less biased, and more aware of bias in ourselves and others. Periodically check in on your biases. Plan with intention, and follow through Be organized and adaptable. Things don’t always go as planned and that’s OK. Planning can help you adapt when they don’t (see Come Prepared). Find a program/project management approach that works for you; being organized can reduce stress immensely and help you progress with your goals. Foster inclusivity within our group and greater community Part of our lab culture is that we are good citizens of our community, we take on leadership roles within our departments, we are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, we actively participate in departmental events, and perform outreach. Work with Kaitlyn when crafting your individual mentoring/development plans to identify what you want to aim your efforts at. Promote and sustain healthy work-life integration Our scientific research is not the only important thing in our lives, and publishing research is not the only mechanism by which to provide science and support our communities. We recognize the importance of our other commitments in keeping us healthy (mentally and physically) and bring our whole selves to our efforts. Try not to normalize overwork or being busy as achievement or status. Practice radical candor We care personally while also challenging directly. Be honest when communicating, accept critical (but kind) feedback, and give the same to others. View relationships within the group as collaborative rather than evaluative. Don’t take constructive criticism personally. Acknowledge and give credit Working as part of a team, we will often (always?) be building on work done by others, receive assistance with work (see “Ask for help”), and using others’ words, code, content. Include acknowledgement and give credit for those contributions, in all forms of communication. We share content and code within the group with this expectation. One easy approach is to include hyperlinks to the work of others or their social media in your work. This also helps to amplify their voice and work as well as yours. 1.2 Code of conduct A Code of Conduct is a set of basic ground rules that we ask participants in lab spaces to follow. The goal is to create an open and inclusive space for our work that helps us achieve our collective goals. Along with our lab culture/philosophy, it also provides a benchmark for self-evaluation and helps better define our identity as a community. This code of conduct applies to all Gaynor Lab spaces, including group and individual meetings (face to face and remote), workshops, social events, email correspondence, and web channels and code repositories, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned and referred to the university’s academic policies. We expect all lab members to adhere to the policies and guidelines outlined here. 1.2.1 Longer version The Gaynor Lab is dedicated to providing a bullying-free and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of race, nationality, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, or religion. We do not tolerate bullying or harassment of participants in any form and prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. UBC provides definitions and examples of bullying and harassment. Harassment includes: Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment. Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names. Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate. Physical contact without consent or after a request to stop. Threats of violence. Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm. Deliberate intimidation. Stalking or following. Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes. Sustained disruption of discussion. Unwelcome sexual attention. Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease. Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse. Publication of non-harassing private communication. The Gaynor Lab prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The PI (Kaitlyn Gaynor) reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding: ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’ Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.” Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions 1.2.2 Reporting If you are being harassed by a member of the Gaynor Lab, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the PI, Dr. Kaitlyn Gaynor, at gaynor@zoology.ubc.ca. If you do not wish to contact Dr. Gaynor, please contact Department Chair (include contact info). We will respond as promptly as we can. Lab members who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the University of British Columbia’s policies and/or the laws of the Province of British Columbia should seek assistance from a supervisor or an HR representative. You can find a link to university policies here. This code of conduct applies to Gaynor Lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Gaynor Lab or another member of the community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by lab members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. To protect our team members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. The above caveats noted, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse when possible. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Gaynor Lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. 1.2.3 Consequences Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Kaitlyn may take any action they deem appropriate, which includes referral to the Department Chair, and also including expulsion from all Gaynor Lab spaces. 1.2.4 License and attribution This anti-harassment policy from the Faylab Manual, which is based on the example policy created by the Geek Feminism community. "],["advising.html", "Chapter 2 Advising and mentorship 2.1 NSERC mentorship statement 2.2 Individual mentoring plans 2.3 UBC expectations 2.4 Committee member expectations", " Chapter 2 Advising and mentorship 2.1 NSERC mentorship statement This is the mentorship statement that I (Kaitlyn) wrote as part of the application for the 2022 NSERC Discovery Grant that funds our work. I share it here so that all lab members know where I am coming from: Once students are in my group, I will adopt an individualized approach to mentoring. Through Individualized Mentoring Plans, I will help students articulate their own measurable and achievable goals and areas for improvement each year, and we will review these plans at the start of each term. I will maintain open lines of communication and check in on progress in weekly 30-minute meetings to hold lab members accountable to themselves, rather than to me, and to ensure that their experience at UBC best prepares them for their desired career. The mentor-mentee relationship must be grounded in mutual respect. I keep an open mind and appreciate the diverse ways of knowing that trainees bring to the table. I will regularly clarify mutual expectations so we are on the same page on subjects such as communication, feedback on materials, and funding. While fostering this mutual respect, I will respect boundaries and acknowledge the power dynamics inherent to the relationship. I will help students to build confidence and skills to meet their goals, including diverse and tailored skill sets in research, science communication, data science, and outreach. I will empower students to take ownership of their work, and cultivate a culture that applauds risk-taking and normalizes failure. Furthermore, it is important to help students not only navigate systems but help them to change them, particularly for students from historically-excluded groups, and I plan to support them in their efforts to make our departments at UBC more inclusive. I also recognize that some students face identity prejudice in the field, which can place them in unsafe and uncomfortable positions, and I will create guidance for fieldwork that promotes safety and belonging. To advance research and training goals, I will foster community and belonging among the research group so that students can lean on each other for support, and not feel that they are competing for my attention or resources. We will share responsibilities for organizing weekly lab meetings, annual lab retreats, collaborative research projects, social events, and lab logistics, and co-create a lab code of conduct to ensure our work and culture are inclusive, feminist, and anti-racist. Students from equity-seeking groups at UBC report less positive experiences, and I will make efforts to align the goals of my research group with those identified in the 2018 UBC Inclusion Action Plan (e.g., develop flexible research practices to accommodate diverse needs; build capacity through skills training; recognize and incentivize DEI activities). I recognize that I will not share all of the same life experiences and challenges as the members of my group, and will therefore encourage students to connect with others in the departments and community for support (e.g., EDI for Trainees in Zoology, UBC Equity and Inclusion Office). Within my research group and larger communities at UBC, I will promote self-education and conversation around difficult topics related to justice, equity, and inclusion. There are also small but important steps that I will take to create an inclusive culture, including indigenous land acknowledgements, pronoun sharing, and the creation of accessible learning materials and infrastructure. Part of creating an inclusive culture starts with bringing our full selves to the table, and talking about how our identities shape our positionality as researchers and our experiences working with agencies and stakeholders. 2.2 Individual mentoring plans Within the first few weeks of joining the Gaynor Lab, you should work with Kaitlyn to develop a plan outlining your short, medium, and long term goals. This is a useful planning document that assists in aligning expectations. Each lab member will revisit the mentoring plan during an individual meeting with Kaitlyn at the beginning of each semester. A template for graduate student mentoring plans can be found here, and is adapted from Stanford’s Office of Graduate Education. A template for undergraduate student mentoring plans can be found here. In addition to these individualized plans, which will guide specific self-defined expectations, Chapter 3 clarifies expectations for all lab members in their interactions with Kaitlyn. 2.2.1 For undergraduate lab members You may be working most closely with a graduate student or postdoc in the Gaynor Lab, in which case they will be your primary source of contact. You should work with them to establish and define your work schedule, protocols for your work, and to ensure you have the necessary equipment to perform your work tasks. Always feel like you can reach out to both Kaitlyn as lab PI. We are excited to help you use your position in the lab to further your career goals and want to work with you to help you achieve them. 2.3 UBC expectations UBC has outlined detailed guidance for mentorship and supervision, including the following expectations for supervisors of graduate students. More details about Gaynor Lab policies on the points below can be found elsewhere in this manual, as linked below. For graduate students, as your supervisor, you can expect me to: Demonstrate commitment to your research and educational program, and offer stimulation, respectful support, constructive criticism, and consistent encouragement. Assist with identification of a research topic that is suitable for you and manageable within the scope of your degree. Have sufficient familiarity with your field of research to provide guidance as a supervisor. Assist you in gaining access to required facilities or research materials for your projects. Discuss your financial support issues and assist with scholarship applications and/or providing advice on academic employment opportunities. Provide guidance in the ethical conduct of research and model research integrity. Discuss with you the implications of engaging with activities/work unrelated to your thesis topic. Provide information about my availability for meetings and expectations about preparation for meetings. Assist you in planning your research program, setting a time frame, and adhering as much as possible to the schedule. Encourage you to finish up when it would not be in your best interest to stay longer. Be accessible for consultation and discussion of your academic progress and research at a minimum of once a term. Minimize my expectations for activities/work that may interfere with your thesis completion. Institute a supervisory committee (with appropriate input from you) and prepare for committee meetings, which will occur on a regular basis (at least once a year) to review your progress and provide guidance for your future work. Support you in your preparation for the comprehensive examination and admission to candidacy which will be completed within 36 months of program initiation. Act as a resource about managing program requirements, deadlines, etc. Attend your presentations in appropriate venues and join in associated discussion. Submit recommendations for external examiners and university examiners for the doctoral dissertation within the time frames required by the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies. Acknowledge your contributions, when appropriate, in published material and oral presentations in accordance with good scholarly practice and the University of British Columbia scholarly integrity policies. Provide reasonable expectations about work day hours and vacation time in accordance with University of British Columbia policies. Clarify my preferred style of communication with students about areas, such as student independence, approaches to conflict, direct questioning, and mentoring. Explain my expectations for mode of address, professional behaviour (e.g. punctuality), when to seek assistance, response to constructive criticism, and academic performance expectations. Assist you to overcome any cultural difficulties with norms and expectations. Respond thoroughly (with constructive suggestions for improvement) and in a timely fashion to submitted, written work. Promote a research environment that is safe and free from harassment. Assist in managing conflict or differences among members of the supervisory committee. Make arrangements to ensure adequate supervision if I am absent for extended periods, e.g. more than a month. Encourage you to present your research results within and outside the University. Provide mentoring in academic writing. Provide advice and mentorship with respect to career opportunities, which may be assisted by resources, skills, professional development, and other avenues. I (Kaitlyn) will make every effort to meet these expectations for each member of the lab, although I acknowledge that I am human, and still learning to navigate my position as a new P.I., and sometimes things may unintentionally slip through the cracks. If you find that I am not meeting these expectations, please bring up your questions or concerns sooner than later (ideally in our individual meetings, or via e-mail if more comfortable) so that we can talk through them, clarify mutual expectations, course-correct, and ensure the situation improves rather than worsens. Feel free to refer back to this lab manual. 2.4 Committee member expectations This guidance is intended for graduate students who have me (Kaitlyn) on their committees, or who are interested in having me serve on their committee. Serving on graduate student committees is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding responsibilities of my job! I really enjoy the opportunity to dive into a diversity of research topics, learn about new disciplines, and lend expertise and advice when relevant. To allow us to get the most out of the student-committee member relationship, I am laying out some general expectations, which we can discuss and adapt according to your individual needs. Ultimately, this guidance will enable me to be the best possible committee member (I hope!). 2.4.0.1 What I expect of you: Touch base with me at least once a year (ideally once a term), even if just a quick e-mail to let me know where you’re at, and what’s on the horizon. Plan to check in with me before embarking on a major aspect of your project (e.g., data collection), either during committee meetings, one-on-one meetings, or via e-mail. This will allow me to give constructive feedback on study design before you have invested a significant amount of time! Please allow me to provide feedback on your chapters prior to submission for peer-reviewed publication. My feedback becomes significantly less relevant to the greater scientific enterprise once a paper has been published! Check in with me several months ahead of large milestones (comprehensive exams, proposal defense, chapter draft completion) so that I can advise you of any limitations in my availability due to fieldwork, vacation, conferences, etc. Please give me a heads up about when you plan to send written material for feedback. If you give me at least two weeks notice that you will be sending me written material to review, I can plan for it, and turn it around within 2-3 days (assuming I’m not out of the office). Without advanced notice, I’ll probably need 2 weeks. When asking for feedback on written material, please let me know what kind of feedback would be most useful (do you want me to comment on high-level ideas, writing, copy editing, figure design, etc.) and if there are particular areas that you would like me to focus my attention (either given my expertise, or given where you feel the greatest need for feedback). For qualifying exams, please discuss reading lists with me several months in advance. You should brainstorm a list of topics and some papers you may be interested in reading, and I can riff off of this list and make suggestions (generally, I recommend an even mix of “classic”/foundational papers, recent reviews/syntheses/perspectives/chapters, and cutting-edge empirical studies) I do not expect coauthorship on papers arising from your thesis (unless you’d like me to collaborate more meaningfully, which I’m always happy to discuss). An acknowledgement is always appreciated if I’ve earned it, which I hope to :) 2.4.0.2 What you can expect of me: I will keep an open mind so that I may learn from you and the other members of your committee. I will give thoughtful feedback on your proposals and chapters on an annual basis, or more frequently if needed, either during meetings or in writing. This feedback will be timely, assuming ample advance notice as discussed above. Prior to your qualifying exams, I would be happy to have a couple of informal meetings to discuss the readings in a less stressful way, and think through ideas they raise together, as they relate to your thesis. These conversations will likely be far more productive than the weird question-and-answer of the exam, and allow you to get the most out of the exam process. If my level of engagement is rising to the level of a coauthor/collaborator (something that we should determine in consultation with your primary advisor), you can expect me to provide an even higher level of contribution (more direct edits to writing, code contributions, greater intellectual engagement, more frequent meetings, etc.) and not just ride your coat-tails! I will make every effort to be constructive, empathetic, and reasonable, and will respect you as the ultimate decision-maker with regard to your own research. I will be honest about my limitations, either in my time or expertise, and try to direct you to outside resources that may be able to fill in any gaps. If you are interested in talking more broadly about professional development or careers, I will make myself available for those conversations. I will loop you into any opportunities for collaboration, presentations, or student mentoring that align with your interests. I will respond to e-mails quickly, and clearly communicate expectations to you (see above!) "],["expectations.html", "Chapter 3 Lab member expectations 3.1 UBC requirements 3.2 Research expectations 3.3 Funding 3.4 Community engagement 3.5 Work schedule 3.6 Research integrity", " Chapter 3 Lab member expectations All lab members are expected to adhere to our lab philosophy (Chapter 1), communication practices (Chapter 4), research practices (Chapter 5), and fieldwork policies (Chapter 7), as outlined elsewhere in this manual. 3.1 UBC requirements Given that our lab members have diverse departmental affiliations and are enrolled in and hired through various programs, with various funding arrangements, it is the responsibility of the individual lab member to ensure they are keeping on top of paperwork related to their own payroll, HR, travel, reimbursements, etc. We can use this lab manual and lab Slack to share information and resources with one another, and please let Kaitlyn know if you have questions or need support. Graduate students are responsible for degree progress. This means you need to stay on top of program and university deadlines, requirements, etc. Before registering for courses each term, you should discuss your plans with Kaitlyn (ideally in our weekly meetings). Resources: Zoology Graduate Student Handbook UBC Graduate Game Plan 3.2 Research expectations The level of independence of lab members in research development will vary according to position, with increasing independence from undergraduate to MSc to PhD to postdocs, and will increase over the course of an individual’s time in the lab. For all graduate students and postdocs, it is expected that research is your top priority during your time in the Gaynor Lab. In addition to following our lab research practices (Chapter 5), you should plan to publish your work in peer-reviewed journals and present it at scientific conferences. Communication of your approach and findings is an essential step in the scientific process. 3.2.1 Publication Graduate students should plan to submit half of their chapters to peer-reviewed journals prior to sign-off on their thesis. For PhD students, aim to submit one chapter to both your committee and a peer-reviewed publication within the first 3.5 years in the program, and a second within the first 5. Kaitlyn and other lab members will support you in navigating the peer-review process, including journal selection, responses to reviewers, and payment of publication costs. When you leave the lab, make a plan with Kaitlyn for the timeline and process of submission of any additional first-authored papers from your time in the lab. If your plans change and you can no longer commit to the publication process on the timeline that we discussed, other members of the Gaynor Lab will be given the opportunity to follow through on the work (with credit given to your contributions, of course). Kaitlyn will talk to you to make a plan well before we reach this point. 3.2.2 Conferences Graduate students and postdocs in the Gaynor Lab are expected to share our research at local, national, and international meetings. We will share information with each other on upcoming conferences, and provide feedback on drafts of posters and presentations in lab meeting. To ensure that we are on the same page when sharing in-progress work with the public and with the scientific community, you should clear any abstracts and slideshows with Kaitlyn and other co-authors. Ideally, you’ll give a practice presentation in a lab meeting, too! Discuss your conference interests with Kaitlyn, and prepare a budget and justification (what will you gain by participating, what will you be presenting?). It is our goal that everyone should be able to participate in at least one local or regional conference each year (e.g. BCTWS) and one national or international conference at least once during their degree. The Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies gives graduate students up to $500 to reimburse travel costs through the Graduate Student Travel Fund, once per degree program. Obtaining reimbursements may take up to 4-8 weeks during peak times. 3.2.3 Authorship policy In our collaborative work, the person who makes the most significant intellectual contributions (in terms of conceiving the original idea, method development, experiment design, analysis) and leads the research and writing of the manuscript will be the first author. Shared first authorship may be an option in some circumstances: for example, when projects are truly co-developed and done equally, or when leadership of a project is handed off from one lab member to another upon leaving the group. However, graduate students should plan to be the sole first author on any papers that arise from thesis chapters. Co-authorship on a paper can be earned through substantial intellectual contribution (e.g., development of ideas, interpretation of results) or contribution to data collection, analysis, and/or writing. Contribution of data alone does not usually merit authorship, but data contributors should be given the opportunity to be co-authors by providing additional contributions. All coauthors should be involved in the writing process by giving feedback on drafts. If you are leading a project that is facilitated by undergraduate researchers and/or field technicians, you are encouraged to provide these individuals with the opportunity to contribute intellectually to the project and earn co-authorship. It is likely that Kaitlyn will be the last (senior) author on most publications led by lab members for research that is primarily conducted while you are in the lab. However, like all co-authors, Kaitlyn should earn this authorship position! Generally, you should maintain open lines of communication with Kaitlyn about your publication plans, so that she can best support you and navigate coauthorship discussions. For papers on which you are the first author and Kaitlyn is last author, the two of you should plan to make collective decisions about the authorship of others. In general, discuss authorship with your colleagues early in the collaboration process, to ensure alignment of expectations and a positive working relationship. The invitation of co-authorship should be made explicitly and in writing. As always, feel free to ask Kaitlyn if you have any concerns or questions about authorship, either of work that you are leading or work on which you expect to be a coauthor. There are many gray areas and unique cases. 3.3 Funding This section applies to graduate students in the Gaynor Lab. The Zoology minimum graduate student stipend is $30,000 annually (including tuition and student fees). The funds to support this stipend do not come from the department or the lab, however, and the stipend is comprised of a combination of TA-ships, fellowships, and GRAs. The exact breakdown will vary by student. This minimum stipend will apply to all students in the lab, regardless of home department (unless the home department has a higher minimum, although as of now, that is not the case for any lab members). For PhD students in the Faculty of Science, tuition will be waived for 4 years. Please note that students in most departments are also expected to pay student fees, which are paid out of the stipend. Fellowships, grants, and other research funding: All lab members are expected to seek and apply for extramural funding to support their work. This includes scholarships, fellowships, and research contracts to go towards their $30,000 stipend (e.g., 4YF, NSERC), but also smaller grants for travel, workshop attendance, or research costs. As a general rule, all graduate students should apply for at least one grant or fellowship every year. In most cases, obtaining a fellowship will not increase the overall take-home pay for the student, but may reduce the need to TA (see details below), and will free up lab funds to support student research, travel, and conference attendance. TA-ships: Graduate students are expected to TA for two terms each year, by default. If a student has fellowship support &gt;$15,000, they are expected to TA for at least one term. Students with fellowship(s) totaling over $30,000 may choose whether or not to TA, with all TA funding going to them. GRAs: We will use lab funds (GRAs or work-learn positions) to bring take-home salaries to $30,000, so long as a student is making satisfactory progress towards degree. These funds should be considered a last resort, after fellowships, TAships, and other funding opportunities have been exhausted. If you are funded from lab grants and contracts, you may need to be flexible in your research and adjust the topic to better align with the current grants/contracts that we have in the lab. If you are funded through a work-learn position, you may be asked to do a small amount of non-research work in service of broader lab goals (e.g., event planning, administrative work). Bonus: Students who earn $24,000 or more through a combination of fellowship and TAships will receive an additional $1,500 bonus on top of the standard GRA, bringing their stipend to $31,500 (or higher, if combined fellowships and TA-ships exceed $30,000). This is in an attempt to keep things reasonably fair amongst students in the lab, while still incentivizing TAing and applying for fellowships beyond what is needed to meet the minimum. Graduating students and postdoctoral researchers are also encouraged to apply for funding to support their next steps. 3.4 Community engagement 3.4.1 Service and outreach All members of the Gaynor Lab should dedicate time to serving our communities—the lab, the departments, the university, the scientific community, and the other communities of which we are a part. Creating and giving back to community is important in building and maintaining relationships, and can also help to hone leadership and professional development skills. This service will look different for each lab member, and ideally should align with the goals that are articulated in Individual Development plans. For example, your service may be oriented towards equity and justice work, event planning, science communication, capacity building, etc. We will support each other in our service work and ensure that this work is recognized and valued. Everybody should recognize that service burdens fall disproportionately on members of underrepresented groups. We should consider how our individual identities may shape the way that we approach service responsibilities and adjust our approaches accordingly. If service work is being done at the expense of satisfactory progress towards degrees and/or research, Kaitlyn will reach out to initiate a conversation about how to best balance responsibilities to align with your goals. 3.4.2 Responsibilities to lab Within the Gaynor Lab, we will assign each individual rotating roles annually, so that we share responsibilities and investment in our research group. These responsibilities may include organizing lab meetings, maintaining the lab website and manual, cleaning physical lab space, etc. Everybody in the Gaynor Lab should seek to provide mentorship, technical support, and assistance to other lab members, especially more senior members of the group. 3.4.3 Attendance and participation All graduate students and postdocs in the lab are expected to attend lab meetings, BRC and departmental seminars, and lab member defenses. We should all make an effort to attend social events put on by the lab, BRC, and departments, especially those within normal work hours. We are all busy, and there will always be something to do that feels more “productive” or urgent than attending a seminar or social event, but we should all recognize that these events are critical for building community. Ultimately, investment in relationships in our professional community will build a network to uplift and support our research, set the groundwork for new collaborations, and lead to new professional opportunities. Even if a talk is outside of your area of interest, use it as an opportunity to reflect on effective (and ineffective) presentation approaches. 3.5 Work schedule 3.5.1 Work hours We should all set the working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this ‘fit’ is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with your main collaborator to outline these. There is value to interacting with others as part of your work, and we do expect you will be available during normal working hours for at least some of the time during the week. Lab members should not expect others to be available during evenings and weekends. We also recognize that there will occasionally be times where there is a need to work more to meet a deadline, but this should be the exception - an expectation of overwork is not to be normalized. 3.5.1.1 Undergraduate timekeeping By each Monday, all undergraduates working in the lab should plan out their anticipated weekly hours that they will be working, on an individual Google form (template is here). At the end of the week, please update this form to reflect the hours actually worked, with details about the specific tasks that were accomplished in this time. This system is not meant to micromanage, but rather exists to ensure that everybody has sufficient assigned tasks, to ensure that we contact you during the hours you plan to work, and ensure that tasks are taking the estimated amount of time (so we can adjust either our estimations or the workflow!) 3.5.2 Time budgeting For graduate students and postdocs, plan to spend 40 hours/week actively working on research, teaching, and professional development activities. The exact breakdown of this time will depend on the nature of your appointment (e.g., TA and RA positions). Some people find that tracking hours is productive for them as it helps them keep accountable to themselves (Kaitlyn uses Toggl for this purpose). Others do not find this method useful. Regularly assess what works best for you. 3.5.3 Vacation Graduate students may take 15 weekdays of vacation, as per UBC policy. You are not expected to be engaged in research or in communication with the lab while you are on vacation. There is no formal system for tracking vacation, but you should let Kaitlyn know when you will be out of the office for longer than 1 day. When possible, try to align your vacations with university holiday periods (this may be necessary if you are taking or teaching courses). Please set up out-of-office notifications on e-mail and Slack. 3.6 Research integrity Mistakes happen. For example, you may make a coding error that accidentally changes your findings. It is always best to bring up this mistakes as soon as you recognize them, so that we can collectively decide how to proceed. As a group, we should aim to reduce errors through data quality control checks, peer review of code among lab members, and frequently asking questions of each other when we are uncertain about data or methodology. Under no circumstances should you fabricate data or manipulate research to obtain a certain result. If you are feeling any pressure to do so in order to make satisfactory progress, or have begun to go down this path and are having second thoughts, please talk to Kaitlyn immediately. This is (hopefully!) unlikely to be an issue in our research group, but should it come to light that you are engaging in dishonest research practices and hiding them from the group, there may be disciplinary action through UBC. This violation of trust will likely mean the end of your time in the Gaynor Lab.

In addition to the official UBC onboarding process (obtaining study/work permits, getting set up with payroll), which you should coordinate with the appropriate departmental staff members, here are some things that you should talk about Kaitlyn about doing when you arrive: Read through this lab manual! Join the lab Google Drive Join a shared Google Drive folder with Kaitlyn Join the lab GitHub organization Join the lab Slack organization Write your Individual Development Plan (Kaitlyn will share template and guidance) Get your keys (discuss this with Kaitlyn); if you are in the BRC or Ponderosa E, Katie Beall will order them for you, and you’ll pick the up at the UBC bookstore UBC offers access to software for students and staff. If you need MS Office, GIS, etc. you can download them here Complete any mandatory on-boarding courses on Workday For graduate students &amp; postdocs new to UBC: + Join the Gaynor Lab and Biodiversity Research Centre Slack organizations (ask Kaitlyn for an invite if needed) + Get your UBC card + Set up a regular meeting time with Kaitlyn + Set up a UBC Zoom account (will allow Zoom calls of unlimited duration… though one could argue about whether this is a “perk”) 4.2 Meetings 4.2.1 Lab meetings During the winter terms, our lab holds weekly 90-minute lab meetings, in person on campus. The first ~30 minutes will be dedicated to individual updates and lab business/announcements. The remaining 60 minutes will be dedicated to the primary topic of the lab meeting. All lab members will sign up to lead meetings on a rotating basis, and will be responsible for setting the agenda for their weeks. The purpose of these lab meetings is to solicit group feedback on research ideas and progress (and, occasionally, professional development). You might use this time to share a draft of a grant proposal, thesis proposal, or manuscript, discuss a paper relevant to your interests, or give a practice talk. All lab members are expected to attend weekly, unless in the field, and to provide written comments on materials in advance of the meeting. In-person attendance is expected for those in Vancouver, but joining remotely is an option when traveling. Please note any virtual attendance or absences on the lab meeting spreadsheet. We will rotate note-taking responsibilities and maintain notes in the lab Google Drive folder. Summer lab meetings will have a different flavour—stay tuned! Prep work for lab meeting The goal of lab meeting is not simply to provide updates on our research projects with one another, but rather to spend dedicated time thinking deeply about ideas as a collective. This is one of the few spaces on campus where we can meaningfully workshop our research with others, so make the most of it! Ideally, we can use the hour to discuss, rather than get up to speed. Given this goal, we should all expect to complete some prep work prior to lab meeting in most cases (and plan to assign it when we are leading). Prep work is also valuable because many people (myself included) come up with better ideas when there is some time to let them marinate, and individual reflection prevents groupthink (a lack of creativity when a group coalesces on the same ideas together). This prep work may involve looking through a draft of a manuscript, proposal, grant application, poster, figure, or published paper that is inspiring your thinking. If you aren’t sure what to assign, ask yourself: what background information do I need to share in order for everybody to get up to speed before we discuss? How can I share this information ahead of time, rather than spending half of lab meeting presenting it? All written materials should be shared with the group via e-mail at least five days before lab meeting (by the Thursday before). We should avoid working on collaborative Google Docs at this stage, again to avoid groupthink, and instead develop our independent ideas. When sending material, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for the lab to help you. If you are asking for feedback, clarify what kind of feedback (big picture ideas vs. line edits on grammar). If there are particular things you are stuck on, or want to discuss, flag these in advance. If you would like to discuss research ideas, provide some questions that will seed the discussion. All lab members should come to lab meeting ready to dive in. Ideally, if you are providing written comments, you should send them to the lab meeting leader in advance of lab meeting so they can review them and integrate them into their agenda. Giving feedback to your labmates We will share feedback respectfully and constructively. This resource from the University of Waterloo outlines the main points of how to give and receive feedback. Feedback shared in the context of lab meeting does not merit coauthorship on manuscripts, although collaborations are encouraged outside of them, and it is good practice to recognize those who gave feedback in Acknowledgement sections as relevant. 4.2.2 Individual meetings with Kaitlyn (grad students) During the winter terms, all graduate students will have regular 30-minute weekly individual meetings with Kaitlyn throughout the year. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with Kaitlyn to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, not Kaitlyn’s. Even if you don’t have anything urgent to discuss, this regularity is important for maintaining open communication, and we’ll fill the time each week! During the summer terms, meetings will be scheduled on an as-needed basis, around your and Kaitlyn’s field, conference, and vacation schedules. Please see these guidelines for “What to bring to a meeting with your advisor” - I think they do a great job of emphasizing what these meetings are for, and how to get the most from them! Each lab member will have a designated Google Doc (visible only to you and Kaitlyn) for agendas and notes for our weekly meetings. (Following templates posted on Twitter by Susana Wadgymar and Michael Hoffman.) By 11am on the day of our weekly meeting, update this file with the following information (don’t spend any more than 15 minutes on this, and don’t feel the need to use complete sentences): Make a short agenda of any things you’d like to discuss in our meeting, in addition to your research plans and progress (if you have anything else to discuss, which may not be the case). I may add to these as well. Annotate the plans from the previous week using the ‘Comment’ feature or by adding text in a different color. We’ll use these notes as a tool for assessing whether we are developing SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-Bound) plans Write a brief self-reflection on the previous week. This reflection is open-ended, but I suggest discussing what went well, what you found to be the most challenging, what you did to try to overcome those challenges, lessons learned, things that I/others can help with, and notes to yourself on what you would do differently in the upcoming weeks. Draft a list of plans and priorities for the upcoming week. 4.3 Communication channels 4.3.1 E-mail Use UBC e-mail for sharing written (non-code) materials or for other communication that would benefit from a searchable record or longer form. You should check your e-mail daily during the work week (M-F). If you do not expect to be able to respond to your e-mails within a day or two, set up an out-of-office reply. Do not expect responses to emails after regular business hours on weekdays, or on weekends. However, because we recognize that lab members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, lab members should not be penalized for sending communication during these times. 4.3.1.1 E-mail etiquette Borrowed from WildCo: Always remember to use a respectful tone and pay attention to proper spelling and grammar when communicating with others about your research. Start emails with a greeting (Dear Dr. So-and-So …). There is a tendency to be informal in communications, but many of your mentors or senior colleagues may prefer somewhat more traditional communications – why start off on the wrong foot? You can adapt to their style (and yours) as the conversation continues. Try to keep emails brief and to the point. What response do you need and by when? Be prepared to follow up on an email if you haven’t had a response in 1-2 weeks. Many people are overwhelmed with emails and simply can’t keep up, so a non-response likely reflects an oversight and people will be happy for a reminder. (Continued non-response after ~3 emails likely means the person is too busy to engage at this time. Try knocking on their door or calling their office if it is important.) If there is an action item or deadline associated with your email, make it very clear (e.g. bold, included in the first line or few). 4.3.2 GitHub Use GitHub issues within the appropriate project repository for discussion of data management and analysis. This allows for an easily-searchable record of notes, decisions, and discussions that can be easily linked to specific code. You should set up your GitHub notifications so that you receive an email whenever there is action on a GitHub issue in a repository to which you contribute. You will then be able to stay on top of conversations and respond directly to issues via e-mail. For specific questions on coding problems, please try to create a minimal reproducible example. Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared. See more on the use of GitHub below. 4.3.3 Slack We have a Gaynor Lab Slack organization, to be used for quick questions or topics for group discussion. Keep in mind that Slack does not have a permanent archive, and that GitHub is better for any project-related conversations for which an easily-searchable archive is preferable. New channels can be suggested/added as needed (but do not overload with public channels, new channels should be suggested to the lab and agreed upon by everyone). For non-time-sensitive questions for Kaitlyn, add them to your agenda for your weekly meeting and plan to discuss them in person, rather than using Slack. As a rule of thumb, if you have a quick question for Kaitlyn that she can answer from her phone on the bus, send it via Slack; if it will require more time, action, or thought, send it via e-mail. 4.3.4 Phone Maybe we could set up a lab phone line, but who uses land lines anymore? For urgent situations or emergencies, you may call or text group members’ cell phones. Please reserve this channel of communication for rare cases so that we can all maintain our work-life balance and boundaries. 4.3.5 Google Drive We have a Gaynor Lab Google Drive folder, which contains meeting notes and relevant shared documents. We will also use this folder to store lab publications, presentations, photos, and data. Everything in this folder should remain internal to the Gaynor Lab unless permission is given to share it more widely. In addition, each lab member will have a designated Google Drive folder shared only with Kaitlyn. This folder will house the Individual Development Plan and weekly meeting notes. Beyond that, you can organize it however you prefer. However, any Google documents that you wish to share with Kaitlyn should be placed somewhere in this folder so that they can be easily tracked down later and not get lost in the vast universe of shared Google Docs. 4.3.6 Lab manual Any information that comes up on Slack or email that is valuable for lab institutional knowledge should be added this lab manual via a pull request. 4.4 Lab collaboration For those of us working in the same study systems, we should take a collaborative approach to sharing data, resources, and ideas, in the interest of doing better science as a team! For the Gorongosa-based researchers, we have a shared, flexible research brainstorming document in the Google Drive folder. This document serves multiple purposes: not forgetting our ideas, sharing feedback on ideas, keeping track of data sets and collaborations, coming up with potential student projects, and making sure we loop each other in on projects that interest us and don’t duplicate effort. If you add an idea to the doc, please add your name, and nobody should move forward with or “give away” an idea without checking in with the person who put it on there. We should not feel like we have to hide ideas from each other, nor that we can’t pursue an idea that someone else is also interested in. Please keep this document internal to our lab for now. I know there is no shortage of good ideas and I highly encourage cross-lab collaboration, but I want to be sure that everybody who is using this document understands the ground rules. Additionally, there will be opportunities for collaboration through co-authoring lab papers. These papers will typically be led by one lab member with some expertise in that subject and all other lab members who are interested in the topic are invited to help. These papers may be meta-analyses, systematic reviews, conceptual frameworks, or other types of research that probably wouldn’t be part of a graduate thesis and can benefit from the lab’s diversity of knowledge. We aim to write around one lab paper a year and expect every lab member who’s interested to have the chance to lead one. We have a document in the Google Drive to record ideas for potential papers. "],["research.html", "Chapter 5 Research practices &amp; resources 5.1 Data management and coding 5.2 Writing and reading practices 5.3 Figures 5.4 Funding 5.5 Writing peer reviews 5.6 Sharing your research", " Chapter 5 Research practices &amp; resources 5.1 Data management and coding The Gaynor Lab is committed to principles of reproducible science. Our primary coding language is R, although you are encouraged to explore other tools that better fit your needs (and teach the rest of us!). All data cleaning and analysis should be conducted in scripts. There will be a learning curve at first, and you’ll be tempted to open up your data files and manipulate them in Excel, but the time investment in learning how to wrangle data in R will pay off in the long run. Code should be complete and well-documented, including information in a README about what each file does and the workflow to run the code. 5.1.1 GitHub for project management We use GitHub for managing research projects. We have a lab GitHub organization, which you should join upon entry to the lab. You may create repositories in your personal GitHub pages for regular thesis research work, but all repositories should be forked to the organization upon project completion or hand-off. In general, one repository should correspond to one thesis chapter/publication, although there are cases where lumping or splitting repositories makes more sense. Create your project repository as soon as you begin managing your data. You are encouraged to regularly commit all of your code to GitHub, on a daily basis. If it works for you, treat your commit messages and GitHub issues as your lab notebook. This may feel vulnerable, especially for those learning to code, but this is a judgment-free zone and there is no better way to learn than to code collaboratively. The use of GitHub makes it very easy to share feedback with other lab members on coding and analysis. By the time of completion, each project should have an easily found README text file that provides information for others so they can navigate and use your work, and give contact information for authors (and any data creators/use restrictions if proprietary data). Ideally, the README should also include links to publications and presentations from the work. 5.1.2 Data management Data used in support of your projects should be: Saved in appropriate, non-proprietary format with accompanying metadata Either in a public archive (e.g., the github repo or another public archive), or if data is proprietary, a ‘snapshot’ version of the data used in the project should be saved in a private repository accessible to lab members. Alternatively, data could be saved on the lab_fay server drive with appropriate documentation. Linked and briefly described in the project README. The average life expectancy of a hard drive is less than the duration of most graduate programs. Thus it is critical to ensure your data and work are backed up regularly. You may have personal backup solutions (e.g. through Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) but the lab has dedicated storage space on a university server that is backed up in multiple locations. Your data should be backed up on here. Include information on how to do this 5.1.3 Resources for learning R From the Faylab Lab Manual Welcome to R! There are so many learning resources out there it can feel a little overwhelming in terms of what to choose! To get you set up and started, Happy Git and Github for the useR is a great resource, and is created by the same authors as the now-legendary stat545.com course. Their resources are extremely comprehensive and they have a fantastic Intro R course, especially for those who will be using R for doing statistics. Right now, we REALLY like this short intro course by @juliesquid &amp; @allisonhorst. They teach a lot of the workflow and tools around using R right from the get go, which we think is more helpful than knowing how to do all the things. The (excellent) materials are thoughtfully put together, link to a ton of other great resources, and just like the online #rstats community in general, are super supportive of new learners. We also really like the Teacup Giraffes R and statistics materials from Desirée De Leon and Hasse Walum. If you want a book to work from/through, R for Data Science is highly recommended. (book is free online) The R Studio Education team have assembled a phenomenal array of courses, tutorials, and other materials for learning R, and for many types of data analyses and modeling using R. These are top notch and so thoughtfully put together. There is something for learners at all levels. A plug for the online R community. Follow the hashtag #rstats, &amp; also check out accounts @RLadiesGlobal &amp; @R4dsCommunity. The weekly #TidyTuesday social coding project is also a great way to practice your growing R skills. Have fun! The R4dsCommunity Slack is a briliant resource for getting help to your R questions and finding tutorials. They also hold online Office Hours where you can get help with R from a real human. The RStudio Community is a great go-to. Learn R from within R with interactive sessions using swirlstats.com. The carpentries R lessons are also a fab resource. 5.1.4 Resources fo spatial data in R Here is an easy-to-use guide for working with spatial data in R: Geocomputation with R Also, check out this new book on Spatial Statistics in R 5.2 Writing and reading practices 5.2.1 Writing process Everybody has their own writing process, and we won’t micromanage each other, but there are a few principles and practices that will greatly facilitate the collaborative writing process. The Gaynor Lab is a safe environment for sharing drafts of in-progress material. You should share drafts of materials in an imperfect state! That said, don’t waste your labmates’ time with unreadable material. Before you commit to writing a chapter or manuscript, you should share an outline with Kaitlyn and other coauthors. This outline should include a breakdown of the topic of each paragraph, and ideally drafts (even hand-drawn!) of the key figures. We will then discuss the outline and decide what elements or analyses are still needed to finalize the story. You can expect me to provide general feedback on what would be the best story we can write with the data we have, or what data we may need to add. It is always easier to finalize the contents and story in the outline process than once the manuscript is already written. All co-authors should have an opportunity to weigh in at the outline and draft stages, and must provide approval on the final manuscript prior to submission. Kaitlyn and your co-authors will provide guidance on target journals and the submission process, including writing cover letters and addressing reviewer feedback. 5.2.2 Reference management Find a reference management system that works for you, if you don’t already have one, and start using it early in your time in the Gaynor Lab to organize papers as you read them. We will likely use Zotero for shared group writing projects, as it is free and easy to use, but you may find another system you prefer for your own research. It is a good idea to develop a system for staying on top of the relevant literature in your field and subfields, which may include the following practices: Set Google Scholar alerts for keywords or authors Create an RSS feed for journals in your field Subscribe to e-mail updates for journal tables of contents 5.2.3 Writing checklist Here are some things to check for in your writing. Please cross-check this list when sharing a near-finished draft of a document (paper, proposal, etc.) for lab review, or Kaitlyn will send you to this list! Don’t use the word “this” without qualifying what you are are talking about (or Kaitlyn will comment, “this WHAT”?) Limit use of adverbs and “filler” words Use active voice, rather than passive voice Be consistent in your use of tense 5.3 Figures If you’re looking for vector silhouettes of an organism, check out PhyloPic! All available for reuse. 5.4 Funding Apply regularly for research funding! Not only will it potentially bring in money to support additional data collection, but it will also help you refine your ideas and develop important skills (grant-writing, budgeting, and science communication). Here are some grants to consider (initials represent Gaynor Lab members who have received them). Please add to the list, and share opportunities with the rest of the lab via Slack! Rufford Foundation (KG) Idea Wild (KG) Explorers Club (KG) National Geographic grants BRITE internship (BRC internal grant; JG) Animal Behavior Society student grants (KG) 5.5 Writing peer reviews Peer review is an important part of science, and you will be given opportunities to jointly peer review manuscripts for scientific journals during your time in the Gaynor Lab. Writing peer reviews can help you to become a more thoughtful, engaged, and informed scientist, and lead to improvements in your own work while giving back to the scientific community and shedding light on the peer review process from the other side. Some good resources for peer review include: PLOS “How to Write a Peer Review” Rebecca Sear, “Good Practices in Peer Review” Brian Lucey, The Guardian, “Peer Review - How to Get It Right” Jennifer Raff, “How to become good at peer review” 5.6 Sharing your research 5.6.1 Press releases Something about press releases can go here? 5.6.2 Google Scholar profiles Having a Google Scholar profile is a very easy way to curate your web presence and have a place where people can find you and your published papers and reports. We recommend everyone sets up a Google Scholar profile as soon as they have a paper or technical report. It takes about 5-10 minutes to set up, and one advantage is that Google Scholar self-updates and will add your papers and citations as you publish and people use your work. This is a really easy step to creating a web presence without having to set up a website. 5.6.3 Personal websites Why have your own website? People will Google you. They might as well see what you want them to. Give people an easy way to find you and your work. One way to do this is a personal website. This doesn’t have to be extensive, but can be a good way to curate your web presence. There are heaps of tools out there to create and publish websites. Our recommendation is to choose something that it is easy to update, and fun / interesting for you to use. Many options are free. Some options for creating sites include: GoogleSites, Weebly, Squarespace, WordPress, R Markdown, GitHub. "],["ubc.html", "Chapter 6 UBC logistics 6.1 Undergraduate engagement 6.2 Office space 6.3 Computing 6.4 Finance and Purchasing 6.5 E-mail 6.6 Zoom 6.7 Poster Printing 6.8 Life in Vancouver", " Chapter 6 UBC logistics 6.1 Undergraduate engagement There are multiple pathways for engaging undergraduate researchers at UBC. Here are some of them: Biology Honours students: Biology students in the Honours track complete independent thesis projects under the supervision of a UBC faculty member, often co-supervised by a postdoc or graduate student. They begin to identify labs in the fall of their third year (and then complete their thesis in their fourth year, although they may start in the summer between their third and fourth years), so start thinking about this early. The process of finding an Honours student begins by contacting the instructors of the third-year Honours seminar. More information here Directed Studies (BIOL448) students: Biology students at any stage of their degree can complete independent research projects for course credit (8-10 hours/week). They must write a 10+ page report at the culmination of their study. More information here Biology Undergraduate Diversity in Research (BUDR): BUDR provides research opportunities to its mentees through the Micro-Experience program (40 hours of work total). In past years, both mentees and mentors have received a small stipend for their participation. More information here Work-Learn Students: The Work-Learn program provides paid opportunities for undergraduates to work on campus, including in labs, up to 10 hours a week during the term. The work does not necessarily have to be research-oriented or educational. The lab pays for the student’s wage, with a subsidy provided by the university. More information here NSERC USRA: The NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Awards provides an award subsidy to hire Canadian/permanent resident undergraduates during the summer to work on your research projects while allowing students to explore workplace and research skills. Applications are usually early in the year (Jan-March) for summer. More information here Work Learn International Undergraduate Research Awards: An alternative to NSERC USRA for international students. More information here APBI 398 volunteers: Each term 1, students from APBI 398 Research Methods for Applied Biology must complete 20 hours of volunteer work for a lab at UBC. There are usually students inquiring about opportunities in the Gaynor Lab (who contact Kaitlyn by e-mail), and it may also be possible to share any opportunities with the course instructor. Volunteers: There are always many students who are looking to volunteer in the Gaynor Lab. We prefer to give opportunities for either pay or credit, however, to promote equity and ensure that everybody is on the same page regarding expectations. 6.2 Office space The Gaynor Lab will eventually be based in the Biodiversity Research Centre, after the construction of the new wing. For the next few years, we will have access to interim space in Ponderosa E (BRC swing space, where Kaitlyn’s office will be located), Lower Mall Research Station (IBioS office), and other Zoology &amp; Botany buildings (Biological Sciences, BRC). These buildings are all within a 5-10 minute walk of each other. We may be a bit scattered, but all graduate students and postdocs will have a designated desk in an office shared with others in the department and/or IBioS. Kaitlyn and Katie Beall (BRC administrator) will work with everybody to make sure you are happy with your office arrangement. We will be sure to schedule regular lab gatherings to make sure we see each other until we’re all housed in the same building. 6.3 Computing The Zoology Computing Unit has a lot of great information on its Wikipedia page, about how to set up your UBC e-mail and use the Zoology computing resources. 6.3.1 Remote Desktop Access The instructions below describe how to remotely access the lab computer in the theory room: Download both Cisco AnyConnect and Microsoft Remote Desktop. You can download Microsoft Remote Desktop from your laptop’s respective App Store. Make sure you are connected to ubcsecure when downloading Cisco AnyConnect. Open Cisco AnyConnect and type myvpn.ubc.ca into the address. This step allows you to connect to UBC’s VPN. Another window should pop up asking for a username and password. Enter CWLusername.zool@app for your username, and your normal CWL password. Note you will only be able to login once you have been granted access to the Zoology server. Email your CWL username to the Zoology Computing Unit in order to do so. Open Microsoft Remote Desktop and click on the plus sign on the upper menu -&gt; Add PC. Enter the PC IP address under PC Name which is 10.34.40.76. Under User account click Add User Account and enter the username (Gaynor Lab Computer) and password (posted on a sticky note on the lab computer) for the lab computer. This ensures you don’t have to enter the username and password each time you want to remotely use the lab computer. Double click on the now added PC within the Microsoft Remote Desktop hub, and you should be able to remotely access the computer! These steps should allow remote access to the computer at any time. Make sure you are connected to the VPN each time you use the computer. Note you do not have to have Microsoft Remote Desktop open the entire time you are running code. If you have code that you know will take a long time to run, you can quit (Command/Ctrl + Q) out of Microsoft Remote Desktop and come back to it later. Do not sign out of the remote desktop as this will stop whatever code you are running. 6.4 Finance and Purchasing We will use the Workday platform for procurement and reimbursement. We have a lab credit card for research-related purposes. Please discuss use of the credit card with Kaitlyn before making a purchase, and check to make sure the intended expense falls under one of our grants. Be sure to get an itemized receipt and send it immediately to the lab member handling expense reports, with the applicable grant speedchart. Consult the Grants spreadsheet for grant/speedchart codes. 6.4.1 General notices for purchasing DO NOT under any circumstance share the lab credit card information with anyone outside of the lab. Please also do not auto-save the credit card information on any web browser. When making a purchase with the lab credit card in another currency, please do not convert it. UBC credit cards can make non-CAD purchases with favourable rates and no fees, while vendors such as PayPal use different exchange rates and may charge extra fees. Please ship orders to the Zoology Shipping and Receiving room (Biological Sciences 1015) rather than personal addresses. For orders involving importing from international vendors, please request the seller to add the following broker information to facilitate shipping and customs clearance: &gt; BROKER: Thomson Ahern – and UBC dept WORKTAG: (speedchart code here) Please send the export documents to prealerts@taco.ca; mbrooks@taco.ca to facilitate pre-clearance prior to shipment arrival. Broker contact: Thompson Ahern | 6299 Airport Rd Ste 506 | Mississauga, ON – Canada L4V 1A2 Contact : Mary Brooks | Direct: 905-677-3471 [Sarah will ask for the Ext. code and direct number…] 6.4.2 Creating purchase orders For purchases that we receive quotes for, we often have to file a purchase order (PO) on WorkDay with the exact amount and items from the quote. Suppliers who provide quotes will then be issued an invoice so they can ship our requested items to us. We will also receive quotes from our colleagues and collaborators for field and research equipment of which we have to report to UBC. This section describes the necessary steps and tips in order to create and file POs via WorkDay. To file a PO follow the “Create Purchase Requisition – Non-Catalogue” steps. Listed below are some tips to help while filing POs: We will most often file a Purchase Requisition for any quotes that we receive. You would only fill out a Bill Only (Retroactive) requisition if a purchase has already been made and shipped to us. If a supplier is not listed in WorkDay, follow the “Create Supplier Request” steps. Do this before you file a PO, as you won’t be able to file a PO otherwise. Make sure the supplier sends all necessary contact and banking information in order to properly fill out the supplier request form. Consult the Grants spreadsheet for grant/speedchart codes and always consult with Kaitlyn to make sure the right grant is applied to the PO. For items shipped to UBC, change the Deliver-to address to Biological Sciences Building –&gt; BIOL-Floor 1-Room 1015. You can search “Biological Sciences Building” in the deliver-to search bar and scroll down until you see Room 1015. This is the Zoology/Botany shipping and receiving office, and where we will pick up any placed orders. Keep the Ship-to address as 6270 University Blvd… Make sure all expense lines in the PO add to the same amount in the received quote from the supplier. The tax section can be confusing, and all of the options are frankly not very informative on their own. Thankfully a member of the UBC Financial team will take care of any tax issues so leave the default options when filling out the PO. Once the items from the PO have been received, create a receipt for the PO by following the “Create Receipt of Goods &amp; Services” steps. Generally, filing a PO is required for invoices over $3500. However, some goods and services are exempt from POs; they are listed in the “PO Exemption Matrix”. This notably includes journal publications (#2) and conference registration (#7) For some supplemental context behind procurement processes and policies, there are “notes” in the Lab Logistics folder from UBC Finance’s PO Process Workshop. If you need any help or run into any issues while filing a PO, email Rafael Passos (rafael.passos[at]ubc.ca). He is responsible for any Faculty of Science POs, and is a surprisingly passionate expert on anything and everything POs. He is a very valuable resource, and will probably also give many tips of his own during the PO process. 6.4.2.1 Gorongosa purchase orders Many of us are purchasing field equipment for our Gorongosa field seasons. All the steps outlined above apply for any Gorongosa-specific purchases, but there are a few more specifics that will make filing any Gorongosa purchase order much easier: Our supplier for any Gorongosa-specific purchases is Gorongosa Project Inc. The items we purchase for the Gorongosa project will be sent to Gorongosa itself, not to UBC. To ensure items are not sent to UBC, write in the Memo space that the purchased items are being sent to Gorongosa OR are being purchased by Gorongosa for field work at our field site. Alternatively, you can also email Rafael (rafael.passos[at]ubc.ca) to let him know. Be sure to attach the PO# (issued after PO is confirmed) or REQ# (generated upon creation of PO) to the email so Rafael knows where to look. 6.4.3 Filing expense reports Any purchases on the lab credit card will show as “Expense Transactions” within WorkDay. For any lab member that has the responsibility for reconciling these charges as a delegate (acting on behalf of Kaitlyn in WorkDay), first follow the “Complete Tasks as a Delegate” steps and click on My Expense Transactions on the resulting page. Then follow steps 2-5 on the “Reconcile UBC Corporate Credit Card Transactions on an Expense Report” post. Listed below are some tips to help while filing expense reports: Credit card charges will often appear a couple of days after the original purchase date. Make sure you only file expense reports for charges that appear on the My Expense Transactions page and that you have receipts for. If you do not have a receipt for a charge, email Kaitlyn or the lab member responsible for the charge. Consult the Grants spreadsheet for grant/speedchart codes and always consult with Kaitlyn to make sure the right grant is applied to the expense report. When creating a memo, write the message as if Kaitlyn was filing the expense report. For example, if there is a charge for a conference fee for a PhD student, let’s say Mark Apple, write “Conference fees for PhD Student (Mark Apple)” in the memo space, not “Conference fees for Mark Apple”. If there are any purchases that require names, fill out the Attendees section with the full names (as listed in WorkDay/UBC) of all participants. 6.4.4 Filing reimbursement If it so happens that an expense is charged to your own credit card rather than the lab credit card, please google “reimbursement ubc workday” and follow the steps from the first link. Be sure to check with Kaitlyn which grant the expense falls under. The cost center will autofill upon entering the grant code. Also make sure to check the enable tax option, as the reimbursement will not go through otherwise. 6.5 E-mail We have a lab e-mail address: gaynorlab.ubc@gmail.com. We can use this as needed to set up lab accounts. Please contact Kaitlyn for the password. 6.6 Zoom UBC offers grad students zoom accounts with premium features, including no time limits on meetings. To get one create a zoom account with your UBC email and then send an email to av.helpdesk@ubc.ca asking them to license the account for research and TA’ing purposes. 6.7 Poster Printing To print posters through the zoology department send a PDF of the poster and a speedchart for billing to Jenny Kao (jenny@zoology.ubc.ca). Expect up to 3 days between emailing and picking up the poster. 6.8 Life in Vancouver We can use this space to share resources on housing, transportation, etc. in Vancouver. 6.8.1 Housing Off-campus housing: Facebook, Craigslist, PadMapper, RentCafe and more exist to find off-campus housing. The Facebook groups “UBC students looking for roommates, housing rental/sublet,” “UBC Room Rentals - Room Exchange” and “UBC Graduate Student Housing Group” are especially popular and useful for finding roommates. On-campus housing: You can find an overview of on-campus housing here. UBC has two graduate student housing options as well that include meal plans. On-campus housing tends to have a long wait list, so if you are interested, apply as soon as you can. 6.8.2 Transportation Public transportation: As apart of your student fees at UBC, you will be enrolled in the U-Pass program. After you link your U-Pass account to a Compass card, you will have unlimited access to buses, Skytrains and the Seabus. You can find more information on transportation around Vancouver here "],["fieldwork.html", "Chapter 7 Fieldwork 7.1 Planning 7.2 Field safety 7.3 Travel insurance &amp; medical care 7.4 Animal Care and Use 7.5 Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique", " Chapter 7 Fieldwork For some members of the Gaynor Lab, fieldwork will be an important component of research. This page is created to share information and expectations regarding local and international fieldwork, and will grow as our members begin to work in additional field sites. Please update this page with the most recent information as you prepare and complete your field seasons. 7.1 Planning You will need to carefully plan your fieldwork as part of your overall work plan. Well before embarking on field work you should prepare the following items and/or discuss them with Kaitlyn: Objectives of field work Proposed timing Proposed budget (and sources of funds secured vs. needed). Can include range, e.g. from cheapest to dream budget Permits: are permits required (e.g. from provincial/local governments? First Nations?) Ethics: is an Animal Care or Human Ethics protocol required? (see below) Safety: a field safety plan is required (see below) Are there particular considerations regarding Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (including anti-racism, reconciliation, capacity-building)? As you are more than likely researching live wild animals (even if through non-invasive techniques) you will need to complete the UBC Animal Care protocols (or be included under an existing one for WildCo) and if you are also including human subjects, you will need to complete the Human Ethics protocol (which may be needed for public privacy in camera trap surveys, participant surveys, or engaging with communities). 7.2 Field safety UBC Student Safety Abroad has some information that is relevant for people traveling abroad for fieldwork. If you are doing international fieldwork, you will need to register with UBC’s Safety Registry. Depending on the country you are going to, there may be additional steps or forms you will need to take or fill out (e.g register with the Canadian government). Be sure to check the government page for travel advisories. The email for Safety Abroad is safety.abroad@ubc.ca. On campus, they are located in the UBC Life Building (1100-6138 Student Union Boulevard). Physical and emotional safety is paramount in the field. If you ever feel unsafe, please try to leave the situation and contact Kaitlyn immediately. We’ll have a more detailed safety protocol in place here before anybody in the lab begins fieldwork. The following subsections have information pulled from Kwasi’s Field Safety Presentation. You are encouraged to revisit the slideshow, and reflect on what safety in the field means to you. 7.2.1 Field safety plans Prior to conducting any field research while affiliated with UBC, you must complete a travel and field safety form to be approved through the Department of Zoology. Kaitlyn has drafted these in the past, and we can build on old versions, so talk to her prior to starting to write a plan. Generally, while preparing for fieldwork, you should ask and/or know about the following: Who and where are your points of contact in case of emergency? This includes people locally (eg. emergency services) as well as back home (eg. partners) How will you communicate with teammates, and what are the rules/expectations? How will you be transported to and between locations? Be sure to make your itinerary clear. What should you expect? What are the risks, protocols, and required training? Again, a clear itinerary is important. What are the no-go criteria? In what circumstances will the fieldwork be halted for the day or entirely? What are the health related protocols? eg. first-aid kit, people with first-aid certification (see below), required vaccinations, protocols for people needing regular medication/treatment. 7.2.2 First aid All lab members are strongly encouraged to complete a wilderness first aid course prior to their first field season. Coast Wilderness Medical Training offers a 40-hour wilderness first aid course about twice a month. The course is taught in Pacific Spirit Park and can either be taken over two weekends or in 4 consecutive days. Upon completion you will earn a Red Cross Wilderness First Aid certificate with CPR-C. Kaitlyn can cover the expenses of this course. 7.2.3 Preparing for the field The following steps will all help with field preparation and the actual trip itself. Familiarize yourself with your destination. This includes knowing where the nearby towns are, and identifying potential risk factors. Complete training (eg. wilderness first aid) and practice skills (relevant vehicle/equipment use, backpacking, familiarizing yourself with recent research) Collect and stock up on your gear and supplies. Know what you’ll have access to, and start collecting early in case you have trouble obtaining something. Bring backups! Get to know your team! 7.3 Travel insurance &amp; medical care UBC Health Insurance provides Travel Insurance, however, not all medication is covered (e.g. anti-malarial medication) and most travel vaccines are not covered. For detailed information about what may or may not be covered by your insurance plan, it is recommended that you check out the AMS Student Care website and to directly contact Student Health Services (1-877-795-4421). On campus, the address is AMS/GSS Care Office Room 3128, The Nest Building, 6133 University Boulevard. If you need medication or vaccines for travel to particular countries you can get these at a travel clinic. There are several located throughout Vancouver and you may need to call ahead for an appointment or to check that the vaccine you need is in stock at the clinic. 7.4 Animal Care and Use You need to create an account on UBC RISe (Research Information Systems) and complete the ethics module. Talk to Kaitlyn about whether there is an existing ACUC protocol for your research project, to which you can be added, or whether you will need to submit a new one. 7.5 Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique Some members of the Gaynor Lab will be working in Gorongosa National Park, or Parque Nacional da Gorongosa, in central Mozambique, where Kaitlyn has been working here since 2015. This section of the lab manual will serve to provide guidance and share knowledge about logistics in the park. 7.5.1 Logistics As you begin to plan your field season, ask Kaitlyn to put you in touch with the Gorongosa National Park Research Manager, Miguel Lajas. Miguel will share research permit forms and provide a document with the latest information for visiting researchers about accommodation, meals, transport, recommended packing lists, and other logistics. We will also maintain a copy of this document in the Gaynor Lab Google Drive. The information below is meant to supplement the park guide. Travel You should plan to fly into the Beira airport (BEW). The park will arrange for your transport to Chitengo, the park headquarters, by road (~5 hours) or small aircraft (~30 minutes). If you have &gt;20kg of luggage, your luggage will need to be transferred by road, so let the park know when you arrange for your transfer. You should plan for road transfer in one of your first visits to the park (perhaps on the way home, when you aren’t yet so travel-weary!), to better understand the local context. Visas You may need to obtain a visa at the Mozambican consulate in Canada in advance of your travels. At times, these visas have been issued for 90 days, but lately they are limited to 30, requiring you to leave and re-enter the country from Zimbabwe or South Africa. Sometimes you will be issued a tourist visa, and other times a business visa. In all cases, you should obtain an official letter from Gorongosa National Park inviting you to visit (Miguel can help you with this). As of 2023, citizens of certain countries (including the United States) can obtain a visa upon arrival to the Beira airport. It is your responsibility to make sure you get an appropriate visa and do not overstay it (the fees will be large!) In summary, visa regulations have changed considerably over the years, so ask your labmates and ask Miguel to put you in touch with researchers who have recently navigated the process. And update this manual with your experiences! Doing fieldwork Our lab field vehicle will be a Toyota Land Cruiser. To conduct independent fieldwork, you will need to have a driver’s license, be comfortable driving a 4WD manual right-side-drive vehicle in muddy and rugged conditions with unpredictable wildlife, and to know the basics of changing a tyre and checking fluids. You can learn some of these skills in the field as needed (Kaitlyn did!) and will need to demonstrate your driving abilities to Scientific Services staff prior to being cleared to drive on your own. You must be accompanied by a ranger (“fiscal” in Portuguese) and take a radio with you into the field (both provided by Scientific Services). Equipment It is very difficult to procure research materials once you are in the field, so bring plenty of anything you think you may need (e.g., flagging tape, Ziploc bags, Sharpies) The avenues for purchasing research equipment are as follows: Through the park’s procurement system. The park uses a consolidator in South Africa, and orders are bundled and shipped to the park via the land border (so allow several months to receive your order). We use this route for purchasing camera traps, batteries, and computers In your luggage. You should be prepared to held up by customs officers and asked to pay customs fees (~20%) at the airport. If you plan to fly with equipment, please communicate with Miguel at least a month before your trip (instructions will be in the information he sents), as they may be able to make arrangements in advance with customs officials in Beira. Note that there have been a couple of instances of luggage containing expensive equipment mysteriously disappearing during transfer in JNB, so take care. Shipments via DHL. This may take a very long time, and may get held up at customs, so is the least desirable option. You may store research equipment in the visiting researcher storage room at the lab in Chitengo, within reason. Please label all equipment, and keep an inventory of everything that you leave behind in the Gaynor Lab Google Drive folder so that we can keep track of what we have in the field. Travel preparation Ensure that you are up-to-date with recommended vaccinations and plan to get a prescription for malaria prophylaxis. You may be able to purchase and activate an eSIM card for Mozambique in advance of your travels (e.g., using the Airalo app). You may also be able to get a physical SIM card, and if you go this route, Movitel has the best coverage in the park. Wireless Internet speeds are adequate in Chitengo for most purposes, although you should be prepared for unexpected outages and slow-downs, particularly in the evenings when more people are streaming and video calling. Social media is blocked during the day, to facilitate work. ATMs in the Beira airport are the easiest way to draw Mozambican currency (meticais). Millenium Bank in Vila Gorongosa has ATMs where international debit cards work, and US Dollars, Rand, and Euros can be exchanged in Beira and Chimoio. Alert your bank ahead of travel so that your account is not frozen for suspicious activity. 7.5.2 Expectations of engagement All lab members should be prepared for respectful, challenging, and important conversations about parachute/helicopter science and the colonial legacies of conservation and research in Africa. Through these conversations and associated actions, we can continue to learn from each other and our colleagues in Mozambique about how to best engage. Learning Portuguese All lab members working in Mozambique should learn to speak Portuguese conversationally. You can get by at the field station with English, but knowledge of elementary Portuguese will facilitate engagement of local interns, students, and park staff in your research. You will be supported in your efforts to learn Portuguese through coursework at UBC or external courses, and we will practice our language skills as a lab! Local partnerships All members of the Gaynor Lab should plan to partner with Mozambican researchers in the course of their research, both in PNG and beyond. For PhD students, you should expect to have a conversation with Kaitlyn and the Gorongosa MSc program director about how you might co-develop your thesis research alongside a Mozambican MSc student. Such a partnership will have many co-benefits in terms of sharing resources, data, skills, ideas, and perspectives. For all lab members, inquire about opportunities to work with interns in the EO Wilson lab during your fieldwork, or to hire local high school graduates. For more advanced lab members, consider co-teaching a workshop or MSc course, either with Kaitlyn or other instructors. Exploring the context The research station at Chitengo can feel isolated from the surrounding community context. All lab members are encouraged and expected to seek out opportunities to get out of the park and meet the people living in and around it. This may come at the expense of data collection, but it will provide important perspective and a much-needed break from the field station bubble. Go to the market in Vila, get a ride to the Shoprite in Chimoio, go home for a weekend with your Mozambican colleagues, visit the mountain, sit in on activities at the CEC, take the boat to Vinho, and opt for a road transfer from Beira rather than air transfer in one of your first field seasons. Close partnership with Mozambican researchers and knowledge of Portuguese will facilitate this type of exploration (see above).
