[["index.html", "Gaynor Lab Manual Policies, expectations, and guidance for members of our research group at UBC Welcome!", " Gaynor Lab Manual Policies, expectations, and guidance for members of our research group at UBC Authored by Kaitlyn Gaynor Updated 2022-07-01 Welcome! The Gaynor Lab at the University of British Columbia is based in the Departments of Zoology and Botany, and affiliated with the Biodiversity Research Centre (BRC) and the Interdisciplinary Biodiversity Solutions (IBioS) cluster. Our research examines the effects of human activity on global biodiversity, with emphases on (1) the behavioral responses of animals to human presence, (2) the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on predator-prey and other species interactions, and (3) the socio-ecological dynamics of conservation and coexistence. You can read more about our research group on the Gaynor Lab website. This lab manual is a living document, and is meant to provide a central place for current and future members of the Gaynor Lab to access information about our policies, expectations, and collaboration and research practices. &lt; link to this book’s GitHub repository Acknowledgements The University of British Columbia Vancouver campus is situated on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam). Much of the content in this lab manual came from other public manuals, including the Faylab Lab Manual, Pinsky Lab, and Bahlai Lab, and expectation documents from Somayeh Dodge (University of California Santa Barbara), Briana Abrahms (University of Washington), and Jerod Merkle (University of Wyoming). "],["philosophy.html", "Part 1 Lab philosophy and code of conduct 1.1 Lab philosophy 1.2 Code of conduct", " Part 1 Lab philosophy and code of conduct This section on lab philosophy and code of conduct is taken almost entirely verbatim from The Faylab Lab Manual, because it resonated so fully with me. It is to be revisited with Gaynor Lab as it grows 1.1 Lab philosophy As part of our core lab culture, we: Ask for help, and share our learning Make ourselves available Come prepared and engage Celebrate accomplishments (ours &amp; those of others) Sustain a positive, safe learning environment Have an interdisciplinary (open) mindset Are mindful of our own biases Plan with intention, and follow through Foster inclusivity within our group and greater community Promote and sustain healthy work-life integration Practice radical candor Acknowledge and give credit to other lab member’s work Ask for help, and share your learning We are all learners, and most of our learning is done from each other. It is inefficient to struggle through problems alone. Ask for and give assistance with appropriate cognizance of the value of your time and the time of the person you are asking. You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem add an issue to the appropriate GitHub repository, and update it with solutions when it is resolved. Also consider sharing it with the larger community by tweeting, leading and sharing at a lab meeting, or running a workshop (Quantfish woRkshop group, SouthCoast useR group, etc). Make yourself available Be responsive to communication, and make time for things that address longer term goals, even when busy. For example, do not skip on things like attending seminars just because you have a big deadline looming. Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Because as a group we value the role of collaboration and interaction in improving our work, it is expected that you be available in the lab/office during normal business hours for some time during the week. Come prepared and be engaged Value your time. Be present during lab and individual meetings, and come to your work ready to do your work. Contribute and participate in planning and lab discussions. When it is your turn to run a meeting, come with an agenda and be prepared with questions. Aim to view meetings as events that contribute to your work and productivity, rather than taking away from them. Celebrate accomplishments (yours &amp; others) You and your colleagues work hard. Things don’t always go exactly as you plan. Be supportive and proud of yourself and your peers when you accomplish things. We are not competing with each other - someone else’s success does not mean your failure. Share your accomplishments with others! Sustain a positive, safe learning environment Everyone learns something for the first time at some time, and people learn in different ways. Expressing that you don’t know something is OK, and we understand that this can make someone feel vulnerable. We strive to maintain a culture that allows for and encourages this vulnerability. Community members should not be disparaged for not knowing things, and in addition, should not be disparaged for knowing things or wanting to learn. Have an interdisciplinary (open) mindset We work on problems that span multiple disciplines. Co-creation of knowledge requires transdisciplinary approaches that can result in solutions that would not be possible with siloing. You will be collaborating with others who have different types of expertise, values, and terminology. Trust the expertise of others and actively seek feedback recognizing the importance of specialization. Be mindful and aware of your own biases We all have biases that are inherent and can not be removed, but we can still work on both being less biased, and more aware of bias in ourselves and others. Periodically check in on your biases. Plan with intention, and follow through Be organized and adaptable. Things don’t always go as planned and that’s OK. Planning can help you adapt when they don’t (see Come Prepared). Find a program/project management approach that works for you; being organized can reduce stress immensely and help you progress with your goals. Foster inclusivity within our group and greater community Part of our lab culture is that we are good citizens of our community, we take on leadership roles within our departments, we are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, we actively participate in departmental events, and perform outreach. Work with Kaitlyn when crafting your individual mentoring/development plans to identify what you want to aim your efforts at. Promote and sustain healthy work-life integration Our scientific research is not the only important thing in our lives, and publishing research is not the only mechanism by which to provide science and support our communities. We recognize the importance of our other commitments in keeping us healthy (mentally and physically) and bring our whole selves to our efforts. Try not to normalize overwork or being busy as achievement or status. Practice radical candor We care personally while also challenging directly. Be honest when communicating, accept critical (but kind) feedback, and give the same to others. View relationships within the group as collaborative rather than evaluative. Don’t take constructive criticism personally. Acknowledge and give credit Working as part of a team, we will often (always?) be building on work done by others, receive assistance with work (see “Ask for help”), and using others’ words, code, content. Include acknowledgement and give credit for those contributions, in all forms of communication. We share content and code within the group with this expectation. One easy approach is to include hyperlinks to the work of others or their social media in your work. This also helps to amplify their voice and work as well as yours. 1.2 Code of conduct A Code of Conduct is a set of basic ground rules that we ask participants in lab spaces to follow. The goal is to create an open and inclusive space for our work that helps us achieve our collective goals. Along with our lab culture/philosophy, it also provides a benchmark for self-evaluation and helps better define our identity as a community. We expect all lab members to adhere to the policies and guidelines outlined here. 1.2.1 Short version The Gaynor Lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form and prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. This code of conduct applies to all Gaynor Lab spaces, including group and individual meetings (face to face and remote), workshops, social events, email correspondence, and web channels and code repositories, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned and referred to the university’s academic policies. 1.2.2 Longer version The Gaynor Lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of group members or others in our larger communities in any form. Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. UBC (link) provides definitions and examples of harassment and sexual harassment. This code of conduct applies to all Gaynor Lab spaces, including group and individual meetings (face to face and remote), workshops, social get togethers, email correspondence, and web channels and code repositories, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned and referred to the university’s academic policies. Some Gaynor Lab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. Harassment includes: Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment. Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names. Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate. Physical contact without consent or after a request to stop. Threats of violence. Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm. Deliberate intimidation. Stalking or following. Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes. Sustained disruption of discussion. Unwelcome sexual attention. Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease. Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse. Publication of non-harassing private communication. The Gaynor Lab prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The PI (Kaitlyn Gaynor) reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding: ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’ Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.” Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions 1.2.3 Reporting If you are being harassed by a member of the Gaynor Lab, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the PI, Dr. Kaitlyn Gaynor, at gaynor@zoology.ubc.ca. If you do not wish to contact Dr. Gaynor, please contact Department Chair (include contact info). We will respond as promptly as we can. Lab members who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the University of British Columbia’s policies and/or the laws of the Province of British Columbia should seek assistance from a supervisor or an HR representative. Link to policies here This code of conduct applies to Gaynor Lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Gaynor Lab or another member of the community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by lab members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. To protect our team members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. The above caveats noted, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse when possible. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Gaynor Lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. 1.2.4 Consequences Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Kaitlyn may take any action they deem appropriate, which includes referral to the Department Chair, and also including expulsion from all Gaynor Lab spaces. 1.2.5 License and attribution This anti-harassment policy from the Faylab Manual, which is based on the example policy created by the Geek Feminism community. "],["expectations.html", "Part 2 Individual expectations 2.1 Individual mentoring plans 2.2 What you can expect of Kaitlyn 2.3 What is expected of you", " Part 2 Individual expectations 2.1 Individual mentoring plans Within the first few weeks of joining the Gaynor Lab, you should work with Kaitlyn to develop a plan outlining your short, medium, and long term goals. This is a useful planning document that assists in aligning expectations. Each lab member will revisit the mentoring plan during an individual meeting with Kaitlyn at the beginning of each semester. A template for these, with thanks to @duffy_ma can be found here. Kaitlyn - to create new template In addition to these individualized plans, which will guide specific self-defined expectations, the following guidance clarifies expectations for all lab members in their interactions with Kaitlyn. 2.2 What you can expect of Kaitlyn Positive feedback &amp; constructive criticism on work Professional career support Support for non-technical aspects of making career progress Regular meetings (every week) to discuss work &amp; maintain progress on goals Provide clear and honest appraisal of your funding situation 2.3 What is expected of you 2.3.1 UBC requirements Graduate students are responsible for degree progress. This means you need to stay on top of program and university deadlines, requirements, etc. Before registering for each semester, meet with Kaitlyn to discuss plans for the forthcoming semester (classes, activities, etc.). All lab members are responsible for keeping on top of paperwork related to their own payroll, HR, travel, reimbursements, etc. 2.3.2 Research output Publication Conferences We share our research at local, national, and international meetings, and publish our findings in the scientific literature. Kaitlyn strives to provide financial support for grad students and postdocs to attend conferences. You should expect to give a presentation (a poster or a talk) on your work at these. 2.3.3 Funding All lab members are encouraged to seek and apply for extramural funding to support their work. This includes scholarships and fellowships to pay for salary, but also smaller grants for travel, workshop attendance, or research costs. As a general rule, all graduate students should apply for at least one grant or fellowship every year. 2.3.4 Community engagement Celebrate milestones Attend department events Serve community Mentorship of labmates Attendance Lab meetings Seminars Departmental events 2.3.5 Work schedule Work hours We should all set the working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this ‘fit’ is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with your main collaborator to outline these. There is value to interacting with others as part of your work, and we do expect you will be available during normal working hours for at least some of the time during the week. Lab members should not expect others to be available during evenings and weekends. We also recognize that there will occasionally be times where there is a need to work more to meet a deadline, but this should be the exception - an expectation of overwork is not to be normalized. Time budgeting For graduate students and postdocs, plan to spend 40 hours/week on research, teaching, and professional development activities. The exact breakdown of this time will depend on the nature of your appointment (e.g., TA and RA positions). Some people find that counting all ‘billable hours’ is productive for them as it helps them keep accountable to themselves (Kaitlyn uses Toggl for this purpose). Others do not find this method useful. Regularly assess what works best for you. Vacation note here 2.3.6 For postdoctoral researchers Postdocs are independent researchers and likely will have significant collaboration with researchers at other institutions as part of their research and position. In general, postdocs are expected to: * Be present and involved in lab meetings, workshops, campus seminars, and conferences. * Provide mentorship, technical support, and assistance to other lab members * Communicate both successes and sticking points on a regular basis with the PI * Work independently and collaboratively * Participate in professional development opportunities * Lead and assist in designated research projects * Develop and submit proposals to fund future research While a postdoctoral position is a scientific research position, it is also a training opportunity and a step to something else. Do not feel bad or awkward about pursuing (and taking) employment opportunities, and also training opportunities that help you move toward that next step. We want you to succeed! 2.3.7 For undergraduate lab members You may be working most closely with a graduate student or postdoc in the Gaynor Lab, in which case they will be your primary source of contact. You should work with them to establish and define your work schedule, protocols for your work, and to ensure you have the necessary equipment to perform your work tasks. Always feel like you can reach out to both Kaitlyn as lab PI. We are excited to help you use your position in the lab to further your career goals and want to work with you to help you achieve them. "],["communication.html", "Part 3 Lab communication and organization 3.1 Meetings 3.2 Communication channels 3.3 Online presence", " Part 3 Lab communication and organization 3.1 Meetings 3.1.1 Lab meetings Beginning in Fall 2023, our lab will hold weekly 90-minute lab meetings in person on campus. All lab members will sign up to lead meetings on a rotating basis, and will be responsible for setting the agenda for their weeks. The purpose of these lab meetings is to solicit group feedback on research ideas and progress (and, occasionally, professional development). You might use this time to share a draft of a grant proposal, thesis proposal, or manuscript, discuss a paper relevant to your interests, or give a practice talk. All written materials should be shared with the group at least one week before lab meeting. All lab members are expected to attend weekly, unless in the field, and to provide written comments on materials in advance of the meeting. We will rotate note-taking responsibilities and maintain notes in the lab Google Drive folder. Giving feedback to your labmates We will share feedback respectfully and constructively. This resource from the University of Waterloo outlines the main points of how to give and receive feedback. When sending material, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for the lab to help you. Feedback shared in the context of lab meeting does not merit coauthorship on manuscripts, although collaborations are encouraged outside of them, and it is good practice to recognize those who gave feedback in Acknowledgement sections as relevant. 3.1.2 Individual meetings with Kaitlyn We schedule regular 30-minute weekly individual meetings with Kaitlyn throughout the year. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with Kaitlyn to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, not Kaitlyn’s. Come with an agenda with a list of things that you want to accomplish and work on during that time. Even if you don’t have anything urgent to discuss, this regularity is important for maintaining open communication, and we’ll fill the time each week! Each lab member will have a designated Google Doc (visible only to you and Kaitlyn) for agendas and notes for our weekly meetings. You should add discussion items to the agenda each week in advance of our meeting. 3.2 Communication channels 3.2.1 E-mail Use UBC e-mail for sharing written (non-code) materials or for other communication that would benefit from a searchable record or longer form. You should check your e-mail daily during the work week (M-F). If you do not expect to be able to respond to your e-mails within a day or two, set up an out-of-office reply. Do not expect responses to emails after regular business hours on weekdays, or on weekends. However, because we recognize that lab members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, lab members should not be penalized for sending communication during these times. 3.2.2 GitHub Use GitHub issues within the appropriate project repository for discussion of data management and analysis. This allows for an easily-searchable record of notes, decisions, and discussions that can be easily linked to specific code. You should set up your GitHub notifications so that you receive an email whenever there is action on a GitHub issue in a repository to which you contribute. You will then be able to stay on top of conversations and respond directly to issues via e-mail. For specific questions on coding problems, please try to create a minimal reproducible example. Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared. See more on the use of GitHub below. 3.2.3 Slack We have a Gaynor Lab Slack organization, to be used for quick questions or topics for group discussion. Keep in mind that Slack does not have a permanent archive, and that GitHub is better for any project-related conversations for which an easily-searchable archive is preferable. For non-time-sensitive questions for Kaitlyn, add them to your agenda for your weekly meeting and plan to discuss them in person, rather than using Slack. 3.2.4 Phone Maybe we could set up a lab phone line, but who uses land lines anymore? For urgent situations or emergencies, you may call or text group members’ cell phones. Please reserve this channel of communication for rare cases so that we can all maintain our work-life balance and boundaries. 3.2.5 Google Drive We have a Gaynor Lab Google Drive folder, which contains meeting notes and relevant shared documents. We will also use this folder to store lab publications, presentations, photos, and data. Everything in this folder should remain internal to the Gaynor Lab unless permission is given to share it more widely. 3.2.6 Lab manual Any information that comes up on Slack or email that is valuable for lab institutional knowledge should be added this lab manual via a pull request. 3.3 Online presence 3.3.1 Google Scholar profiles Having a Google Scholar profile is a very easy way to curate your web presence and have a place where people can find you and your published papers and reports. We recommend everyone sets up a Google Scholar profile as soon as they have a paper or technical report. It takes about 5-10 minutes to set up, and one advantage is that Google Scholar self-updates and will add your papers and citations as you publish and people use your work. This is a really easy step to creating a web presence without having to set up a website. 3.3.2 Personal websites Why have your own website? People will Google you. They might as well see what you want them to. Give people an easy way to find you and your work. One way to do this is a personal website. This doesn’t have to be extensive, but can be a good way to curate your web presence. There are heaps of tools out there to create and publish websites. Our recommendation is to choose something that it is easy to update, and fun / interesting for you to use. Many options are free. Some options for creating sites include: GoogleSites, Weebly, Squarespace, WordPress, R Markdown, GitHub. 3.3.3 Twitter Twitter is a great tool for interacting with others about your science. It is also a great platform for learning about new research and papers, finding out about jobs and fellowships, learning and discussing methods, discussing topics about how we do science, professional development, mental health and expectations around science and graduate school, and is a great venue for bringing ones whole self to the science. etc. Twitter can also be a time sink and a major distraction, so be warned. "],["research.html", "Part 4 Research practices 4.1 Data management and coding 4.2 Writing and reading practices", " Part 4 Research practices 4.1 Data management and coding The Gaynor Lab is committed to principles of reproducible science. Our primary coding language is R, although you are encouraged to explore other tools that better fit your needs (and teach the rest of us!). All data cleaning and analysis should be conducted in scripts. There will be a learning curve at first, and you’ll be tempted to open up your data files and manipulate them in Excel, but the time investment in learning how to wrangle data in R will pay off in the long run. Code should be complete and well-documented, including information in a README about what each file does and the workflow to run the code. 4.1.1 GitHub for project management We use GitHub for managing research projects. We have a lab GitHub organization, which you should join upon entry to the lab. You may create repositories in your personal GitHub pages for regular thesis research work, but all repositories should be forked to the organization upon project completion or hand-off. In general, one repository should correspond to one thesis chapter/publication, although there are cases where lumping or splitting repositories makes more sense. Create your project repository as soon as you begin managing your data. You are encouraged to regularly commit all of your code to GitHub, on a daily basis. If it works for you, treat your commit messages and GitHub issues as your lab notebook. This may feel vulnerable, especially for those learning to code, but this is a judgment-free zone and there is no better way to learn than to code collaboratively. The use of GitHub makes it very easy to share feedback with other lab members on coding and analysis. By the time of completion, each project should have an easily found README text file that provides information for others so they can navigate and use your work, and give contact information for authors (and any data creators/use restrictions if proprietary data). Ideally, the README should also include links to publications and presentations from the work. 4.1.2 Data management Data used in support of your projects should be: Saved in appropriate, non-proprietary format with accompanying metadata Either in a public archive (e.g., the github repo or another public archive), or if data is proprietary, a ‘snapshot’ version of the data used in the project should be saved in a private repository accessible to lab members. Alternatively, data could be saved on the lab_fay server drive with appropriate documentation. Linked and briefly described in the project README. The average life expectancy of a hard drive is less than the duration of most graduate programs. Thus it is critical to ensure your data and work are backed up regularly. You may have personal backup solutions (e.g. through Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) but the lab has dedicated storage space on a university server that is backed up in multiple locations. Your data should be backed up on here. Include information on how to do this 4.1.3 Resources for learning R From the Faylab Lab Manual Welcome to R! There are so many learning resources out there it can feel a little overwhelming in terms of what to choose! To get you set up and started, Happy Git and Github for the useR is a great resource, and is created by the same authors as the now-legendary stat545.com course. Their resources are extremely comprehensive and they have a fantastic Intro R course, especially for those who will be using R for doing statistics. Right now, we REALLY like this short intro course by @juliesquid &amp; @allisonhorst. They teach a lot of the workflow and tools around using R right from the get go, which we think is more helpful than knowing how to do all the things. The (excellent) materials are thoughtfully put together, link to a ton of other great resources, and just like the online #rstats community in general, are super supportive of new learners. We also really like the Teacup Giraffes R and statistics materials from Desirée De Leon and Hasse Walum. If you want a book to work from/through, R for Data Science is highly recommended. (book is free online) The R Studio Education team have assembled a phenomenal array of courses, tutorials, and other materials for learning R, and for many types of data analyses and modeling using R. These are top notch and so thoughtfully put together. There is something for learners at all levels. A plug for the online R community. Follow the hashtag #rstats, &amp; also check out accounts @RLadiesGlobal &amp; @R4dsCommunity. The weekly #TidyTuesday social coding project is also a great way to practice your growing R skills. Have fun! The R4dsCommunity Slack is a briliant resource for getting help to your R questions and finding tutorials. They also hold online Office Hours where you can get help with R from a real human. The RStudio Community is a great go-to. Learn R from within R with interactive sessions using swirlstats.com. The carpentries R lessons are also a fab resource. 4.2 Writing and reading practices 4.2.1 Formats We won’t micromanage individual writing processes, but Kaitlyn prefers to provide feedback in Microsoft Word (especially for longer pieces) or Google Docs 4.2.2 Reference management Find a reference management system that works for you, if you don’t already have one, and start using it early in your time in the Gaynor Lab to organize papers as you read them. We will likely use Zotero for shared group writing projects, as it is free and easy to use, but you may find another system you prefer for your own research. It is a good idea to develop a system for staying on top of the relevant literature in your field and subfields, which may include the following practices: + Set Google Scholar alerts for keywords or authors + Create an RSS feed for journals in your field + Subscribe to e-mail updates for journal tables of contents "],["ubc.html", "Part 5 UBC logistics 5.1 Office space 5.2 Computing 5.3 Finance 5.4 Life in Vancouver", " Part 5 UBC logistics The lab is just starting up in Fall 2022, and there’s a lot to learn about how things work at UBC. Be patient as we figure this out together 🙂 More information will go here as we learn! 5.1 Office space The Gaynor Lab will eventually be based in the Biodiversity Research Centre, after the construction of the new wing. For the next few years, we will have access to interim space in Ponderosa E (BRC swing space, where Kaitlyn’s office will be located), Lower Mall Research Station (IBioS office), and other Zoology &amp; Botany buildings (Biological Sciences, BRC). These buildings are all within a 5-10 minute walk of each other. We may be a bit scattered, but all graduate students and postdocs will have a designated desk in an office shared with others in the department and/or IBioS. Kaitlyn will work with everybody to make sure you are happy with your office arrangement. We will be sure to schedule regular lab gatherings to make sure we see each other until we’re all housed in the same building. 5.2 Computing The Zoology Computing Unit has a lot of great information on its Wikipedia page, about how to set up your UBC e-mail and use the Zoology computing resources. 5.3 Finance We will use the Workday platform for procurement and reimbursement. We have a lab credit card for research-related purposes. Please discuss use of the credit card with Kaitlyn. 5.4 Life in Vancouver We can use this space to share resources on housing, transportation, etc. in Vancouver. "],["fieldwork.html", "Part 6 Fieldwork 6.1 Field safety 6.2 Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique", " Part 6 Fieldwork For some members of the Gaynor Lab, fieldwork will be an important component of research. This page is created to share information and expectations regarding local and international fieldwork, and will grow as our members begin to work in additional field sites. Please update this page with the most recent information as you prepare and complete your field seasons. 6.1 Field safety Physical and emotional safety is paramount in the field. If you ever feel unsafe, please try to leave the situation and contact Kaitlyn immediately. We’ll have a more detailed safety protocol in place here before anybody in the lab begins fieldwork. 6.1.1 Field safety plans You must complete a travel and field safety form to be approved through UBC. The lab has yet to create one, but Kaitlyn will be doing this in advance of our first field season in 2023, and we can then reuse within our group. 6.1.2 First aid All lab members are strongly encouraged to complete a wilderness first aid course prior to their first field season. Kaitlyn can cover the expenses of this course, and as we gather more information on offerings at UBC and in Vancouver, let’s update this section of the manual. 6.2 Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique Some members of the Gaynor Lab will be working in Gorongosa National Park, or Parque Nacional da Gorongosa, in central Mozambique, where Kaitlyn has been working here since 2015. This section of the lab manual will serve to provide guidance and share knowledge about logistics in the park. 6.2.1 Logistics As you begin to plan your field season, ask Kaitlyn to put you in touch with the Gorongosa National Park Research Manager, Miguel Lajas. Miguel will share research permit forms and provide a document with the latest information for visiting researchers about accommodation, meals, transport, recommended packing lists, and other logistics. We will also maintain a copy of this document in the Gaynor Lab Google Drive. The information below is meant to supplement the park guide. Travel You should plan to fly into the Beira airport (BEW). The park will arrange for your transport to Chitengo, the park headquarters, by road (~5 hours) or small aircraft (~30 minutes). If you have &gt;20kg of luggage, your luggage will need to be transferred by road, so let the park know when you arrange for your transfer. You should plan for road transfer in one of your first visits to the park (perhaps on the way home, when you aren’t yet so travel-weary!), to better understand the local context. Visas You will likely need to obtain a visa at the Mozambican consulate in Canada in advance of your travels. At times, these visas have been issued for 90 days, but lately they are limited to 30, requiring you to leave and re-enter the country from Zimbabwe or South Africa. Sometimes you will be issued a tourist visa, and other times a business visa. In all cases, you should obtain an official letter from Gorongosa National Park inviting you to visit (Miguel can help you with this). Kaitlyn has recently had success getting a visa at the Beira airport (in 2022) with an official invitation letter from the government (secured by the park) but this was not previously possible. It is your responsibility to make sure you get an appropriate visa and do not overstay it (the fees will be large!) In summary, visa regulations have changed considerably over the years, so ask your labmates and ask Miguel to put you in touch with researchers who have recently navigated the process. And update this manual with your experiences! Doing fieldwork Our lab field vehicle will be a Toyota Land Cruiser. To conduct independent fieldwork, you will need to have a driver’s license, be comfortable driving a 4WD manual right-side-drive vehicle in muddy and rugged conditions with unpredictable wildlife, and to know the basics of changing a tyre and checking fluids. You can learn some of these skills in the field as needed (Kaitlyn did!) and will need to demonstrate your driving abilities to Scientific Services staff prior to being cleared to drive on your own. You must be accompanied by a ranger (“fiscal” in Portuguese) and take a radio with you into the field (both provided by Scientific Services). Equipment It is very difficult to procure research materials once you are in the field, so bring plenty of anything you think you may need (e.g., flagging tape, Ziploc bags, Sharpies) The avenues for purchasing research equipment are as follows: Through the park’s procurement system. The park uses a consolidator in South Africa, and orders are bundled and shipped to the park via the land border (so allow several months to receive your order). We use this route for purchasing camera traps, batteries, and computers In your luggage. You should be prepared to held up by customs officers and asked to pay customs fees (~20%) at the airport. If you plan to fly with equipment, please communicate with Miguel at least a month before your trip (instructions will be in the information he sents), as they may be able to make arrangements in advance with customs officials in Beira. Note that there have been a couple of instances of luggage containing expensive equipment mysteriously disappearing during transfer in JNB, so take care. Shipments via DHL. This may take a very long time, and may get held up at customs, so is the least desirable option. You may store research equipment in the visiting researcher storage room at the lab in Chitengo, within reason. Please label all equipment, and keep an inventory of everything that you leave behind in the Gaynor Lab Google Drive folder so that we can keep track of what we have in the field. Travel preparation Ensure that you are up-to-date with recommended vaccinations and plan to get a prescription for malaria prophylaxis. You may be able to purchase and activate an eSIM card for Mozambique in advance of your travels. Movitel has the best coverage in the park. Wireless Internet speeds are adequate in Chitengo for most purposes, although you should be prepared for unexpected outages and slow-downs. Social media is blocked during the day, to facilitate work. ATMs in the Beira airport are the easiest way to draw Mozambican currency (meticais). Millenium Bank in Vila Gorongosa has ATMs where international debit cards work, and US Dollars, Rand, and Euros can be exchanged in Beira and Chimoio. Alert your bank ahead of travel so that your account is not frozen for suspicious activity. 6.2.2 Expectations of engagement All lab members should be prepared for respectful, challenging, and important conversations about parachute/helicopter science and the colonial legacies of conservation and research in Africa. Through these conversations and associated actions, we can continue to learn from each other and our colleagues in Mozambique about how to best engage. Learning Portuguese All lab members working in Mozambique should learn to speak Portuguese conversationally. You can get by at the field station with English, but knowledge of elementary Portuguese will facilitate engagement of local interns, students, and park staff in your research. You will be supported in your efforts to learn Portuguese through coursework at UBC or external courses, and we will practice our language skills as a lab! Local partnerships All members of the Gaynor Lab should plan to partner with Mozambican researchers in the course of their research, both in PNG and beyond. For PhD students, you should expect to have a conversation with Kaitlyn and the Gorongosa MSc program director about how you might co-develop your thesis research alongside a Mozambican MSc student. Such a partnership will have many co-benefits in terms of sharing resources, data, skills, ideas, and perspectives. For all lab members, inquire about opportunities to work with interns in the EO Wilson lab during your fieldwork, or to hire local high school graduates. For more advanced lab members, consider co-teaching a workshop or MSc course, either with Kaitlyn or other instructors. Exploring the context The research station at Chitengo can feel isolated from the surrounding community context. All lab members are encouraged and expected to seek out opportunities to get out of the park and meet the people living in and around it. This may come at the expense of data collection, but it will provide important perspective and a much-needed break from the field station bubble. Go to the market in Vila, get a ride to the Shoprite in Chimoio, go home for a weekend with your Mozambican colleagues, visit the mountain, sit in on activities at the CEC, take the boat to Vinho, and opt for a road transfer from Beira rather than air transfer in one of your first field seasons. Close partnership with Mozambican researchers and knowledge of Portuguese will facilitate this type of exploration (see above).
