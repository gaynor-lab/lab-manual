Here are some of them: Biology Honours students: Biology students in the Honours track complete independent thesis projects under the supervision of a UBC faculty member, often co-supervised by a postdoc or graduate student. They begin to identify labs in the fall of their third year (and then complete their thesis in their fourth year, although they may start in the summer between their third and fourth years), so start thinking about this early. The process of finding an Honours student begins by contacting the instructors of the third-year Honours seminar. More information here Directed Studies (BIOL448) students: Biology students at any stage of their degree can complete independent research projects for course credit (8-10 hours/week). They must write a 10+ page report at the culmination of their study. More information here Biology Undergraduate Diversity in Research (BUDR): BUDR provides research opportunities to its mentees through the Micro-Experience program (40 hours of work total). In past years, both mentees and mentors have received a small stipend for their participation. More information here Work-Learn Students: The Work-Learn program provides paid opportunities for undergraduates to work on campus, including in labs, up to 10 hours a week during the term. The work does not necessarily have to be research-oriented or educational. The lab pays for the student’s wage, with a subsidy provided by the university. More information here NSERC USRA: The NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Awards provides an award subsidy to hire Canadian/permanent resident undergraduates during the summer to work on your research projects while allowing students to explore workplace and research skills. Applications are usually early in the year (Jan-March) for summer. More information here Work Learn International Undergraduate Research Awards: An alternative to NSERC USRA for international students. More information here APBI 398 volunteers: Each term 1, students from APBI 398 Research Methods for Applied Biology must complete 20 hours of volunteer work for a lab at UBC. There are usually students inquiring about opportunities in the Gaynor Lab (who contact Kaitlyn by e-mail), and it may also be possible to share any opportunities with the course instructor. Volunteers: There are always many students who are looking to volunteer in the Gaynor Lab. We prefer to give opportunities for either pay or credit, however, to promote equity and ensure that everybody is on the same page regarding expectations. 7.2 Office space The Gaynor Lab will eventually be based in the Biodiversity Research Centre, after the construction of the new wing. For the next few years, we will have access to interim space in Ponderosa E (BRC swing space, where Kaitlyn’s office will be located), Lower Mall Research Station (IBioS office), and other Zoology &amp; Botany buildings (Biological Sciences, BRC). These buildings are all within a 5-10 minute walk of each other. We may be a bit scattered, but all graduate students and postdocs will have a designated desk in an office shared with others in the department and/or IBioS. Kaitlyn and Katie Beall (BRC administrator) will work with everybody to make sure you are happy with your office arrangement. We will be sure to schedule regular lab gatherings to make sure we see each other until we’re all housed in the same building. 7.3 Computing The Zoology Computing Unit has a lot of great information on its Wikipedia page, about how to set up your UBC e-mail and use the Zoology computing resources. 7.3.1 Remote Desktop Access The instructions below describe how to remotely access the lab computer in the theory room: Download both Cisco AnyConnect and Microsoft Remote Desktop. You can download Microsoft Remote Desktop from your laptop’s respective App Store. Make sure you are connected to ubcsecure when downloading Cisco AnyConnect. Open Cisco AnyConnect and type myvpn.ubc.ca into the address. This step allows you to connect to UBC’s VPN. Another window should pop up asking for a username and password. Enter CWLusername.zool@app for your username, and your normal CWL password. Note you will only be able to login once you have been granted access to the Zoology server. Email the Zoology Computing Unit in order to do so. Open Microsoft Remote Desktop and click on the plus sign on the upper menu -&gt; Add PC. Enter the PC IP address under PC Name which is 10.34.40.76. Under User account click Add User Account and enter the username (Gaynor Lab Computer) and password (Leop@rD1523!!) for the lab computer. This ensures you don’t have to enter the username and password each time you want to remotely use the lab computer. Double click on the now added PC within the Microsoft Remote Desktop hub, and you should be able to remotely access the computer! These steps should allow remote access to the computer at any time. Make sure you are connected to the VPN each time you use the computer. Note you do not have to have Microsoft Remote Desktop open the entire time you are running code. If you have code that you know will take a long time to run, you can quit (Command/Ctrl + Q) out of Microsoft Remote Desktop and come back to it later. Do not sign out of the remote desktop as this will stop whatever code you are running. 7.4 Finance We will use the Workday platform for procurement and reimbursement. We have a lab credit card for research-related purposes. Please discuss use of the credit card with Kaitlyn. Be sure to get an itemized receipt. 7.5 E-mail We have a lab e-mail address: gaynorlab.ubc@gmail.com. We can use this as needed to set up lab accounts. Please contact Kaitlyn for the password. 7.6 Life in Vancouver We can use this space to share resources on housing, transportation, etc. in Vancouver. 7.6.1 Housing Off-campus housing: Facebook, Craigslist, PadMapper, RentCafe and more exist to find off-campus housing. The Facebook groups “UBC students looking for roommates, housing rental/sublet,” “UBC Room Rentals - Room Exchange” and “UBC Graduate Student Housing Group” are especially popular and useful for finding roommates. On-campus housing: You can find an overview of on-campus housing here. UBC has two graduate student housing options as well that include meal plans. On-campus housing tends to have a long wait list, so if you are interested, apply as soon as you can. 7.6.2 Transportation Public transportation: As apart of your student fees at UBC, you will be enrolled in the U-Pass program. After you link your U-Pass account to a Compass card, you will have unlimited access to buses, Skytrains and the Seabus. You can find more information on transportation around Vancouver here "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
