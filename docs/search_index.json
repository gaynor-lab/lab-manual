The Gaynor Lab at the University of British Columbia is based in the Departments of Zoology and Botany, and affiliated with the Biodiversity Research Centre (BRC) and the Interdisciplinary Biodiversity Solutions (IBioS) Collaboratory. Our research examines the effects of human activity on global biodiversity, with emphases on (1) the behavioral responses of animals to human presence, (2) the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on predator-prey and other species interactions, and (3) the socio-ecological dynamics of conservation and coexistence. You can read more about our research group on the Gaynor Lab website. This lab manual is a living document, and is meant to provide a central place for current and future members of the Gaynor Lab to access information about our policies, expectations, and collaboration and research practices. &lt;- link to this book’s GitHub repository Acknowledgements The University of British Columbia Vancouver campus is situated on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam).
